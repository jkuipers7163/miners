3  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
 
The Company was incorporated on October 10, 1986  under the laws of British Columbia as Ayubowan Capital 
Ltd. On June 13, 2017, the Company’s name was changed to Discovery Metals Corp. On April 14, 2021, the 
Company’s name was changed to Discovery Silver Corp. The Company ’s Common Shares are listed on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “DSV”, on the OTCQX under the symbol “DSVSF”, and on the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “1CU0”.  
 
Discovery is a growing precious metals producer with assets in Canada and Mexico. The Company is principally 
engaged in the exploration , development and operation of mineral properties  that have demonstrated potential 
for profitable operations and for generating attractive returns for all stakeholders. Discovery’s first asset is the  
100% -owned Cordero silver development -stage project (“ Cordero” or the “Project ”) located on a prolific mining 
belt i n Chihuahua State, Mexico. A feasibility study (“FS”)  dated F ebruary 16, 2024  clearly demonstrated the 
potential for Cordero to be developed into one of the largest silver mines globally, with low unit costs that is 
capable of generating attractive economic returns.  Since release of the FS, work at Cordero has focused on 
continuin g to de -risk the project, and to advance the permitting process, with Cordero’s Environmental Impact 
Statement (“Manifesto de Impacto Ambiental” or “MIA”)  currently being reviewed by the Mexican 
Government’s department of natural resources and environment (“Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos 
Naturales or “SEMARNAT” ). 
 
On April 1 5, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition (“Porcupine Acquisition” or “Acquisition”) of the 
Porcupine Complex (the “Porcupine Operations” or “Porcupine”) from Newmont Corporation (“Newmont”).  
The Acquisition establishes Discover y as a new Canadian -based gold producer, with multiple operations, a large 
base of Mineral Resources and substantial potential for growth  in one of the world’s most prolific gold camps. 
With the closing of the Acquisition, the Company will report gold production, and related costs, from the 
Porcupine Operations commencing in the second quarter of 2025.  
 
A key component of Discovery ’s business is its commitment to achieving excellence in all aspects of responsible 
mining . Consi stent with this commitment,  the Company has been honoured with numerous awards in Mexico, 
including: receiving both the Socially Responsible Enterprise distinction from the Mexican Center for 
Philanthropy (“CEMEFI”) and the  international  Great Place to Work Certification for the third consecutive year 
in 2024 ; receiving CEMEFI’s Best Environmental Practices distinction f or the first time 2024; and being awarded 
the two -year Quality Environmental Certification from Mexico’ s Federal Attorney’s Office for Environmental 
Protection or “PROFEPA”  in November 2023. The Company also supports energy transition, with plans to 
increase the use of electric vehicles and other equipment at Porcupine, and the ongoing evaluation of using 
solar energy, battery electric, trolley assist and other alternative e nergy systems in the development and 
operation of Cordero.

PORCUPINE OVERVIEW  
 
The Porcupine Operations of Discovery cover approximately 1,400 km2 in and near Timmins, Ontario . Porcupine 
consists of the Hoyle Pond, Pamour and Hollinger mine properties, the Dome mine property and milling facility 
(collectively “Dome”), and numerous near -mine and regional exploration targets in and around Timmins, 
Ontario. The Complex also includ es the Borden mining operation and large, highly prolific, land position near 
Chapleau, Ontario. Current operations include the Hoyle Pond and Borden undergroun d mines, with production 
at the Pamour open -pit project expected to ramp up throughout 2025. All mineralization from the operating 
mines is treated at Dome, including mineralization from Borden, which is trucked 190 km to the Dome Mill.  
 
Based on the recent technical report (the “Technical Report”), annual production at Porcupine is expected to 
average over 285,000 ounces of gold for the next 10 years, with total production extending to 2046. Discovery 
expects to improve on the estimates in the Technic al Report through investment in the assets to grow 
production, extend mine life and lower costs at existing operations. The Company also plans extensive 
exploration drilling, with there being multiple attractive drill targets at each asset and  significant regional 
exploration potential.   DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
5   
Key highlights of the Porcupine Operations and their upside potential are provided below.  
• Hoyle Pond: A high -grade  gold mine that has produced over four million ounces of gold since 1987 and, 
over that period, has established a solid  track record for replacing reserves.  
• Borden: A relatively new mine at the centre of a 1,000 km2 land position with potential to extend 
existing mining zones and where there has been limited exploration outside of the current mining area.  
• Pamour: A new open -pit operation with a 22 -year mine life with growth potential through exploration 
success.  
• Dome Mine: A century -old gold producer  where there remains a large mineral resource and  exploration 
upside.  
• Dome Mill: A central processing facility currently operating below capacity levels and with significant 
growth potential to accommodate increased production.  
 
CORDERO OVERVIEW  
 
The Cordero Project was acquired by Discovery in 2019.  Since that time, significant exploration drilling and 
technical analysis has been completed, leading to the release of multiple studies, most recently the FS dated 
February 16 2024 and filed on SEDAR+ ( www.sedarplus.ca ) on March 28, 2024. The results of the FS confirmed 
Cordero to be one of the world’s largest undeveloped silver deposits, with the potential for large -scale 
production at low unit costs and that is capable of generating substantial free cash flow and attr active economic 
returns.  
 
Key highlights of the Feasibility Study include:  
• Average annual production of 37 million silver equivalent ounces (“AgEq”) over the first 1 2 years with 
a total project life of 19 years;  
• All-in sustaining costs averaging below USD$12.50 per AgEq ounce in Years 1 – 8; 
• Base -case after -tax net present value (“NPV”) of USD$1.2 billion (Base -case metal prices: Silver – $22.00 
per ounce; Gold – USD$1,600 per ounce; Zinc – USD$1.20 per ounce; Lead – USD$1.00 per ounce) ; 
• Initial capital expenditures of USD$606 million (resulting in a NPV to capital ratio of 2:1);  
• Large -scale Mineral Reserve totaling 302 million ounces of silver, 840,000 ounces of gold, 5.2 billion 
pounds of zine and 3.0 billion pounds of lead;  
• Important socio -economic contribution to Mexico, including significant  job creation and billions of 
dollars in investment, local procurement and tax payments; and,  
• High levels of environment responsibility and a commitment to contributing to the management of key 
social issues such as carbon reduction and water quality and availability.  
 
First Quarter 2025 Highlights  
On March 19, 2025, the Company achieved a significant milestone with the acquisition of 66 hectares of land 
near the planned location of the Cordero processing plant. With this acquisition, Discovery now owns 100% of 
the land required to advance Cordero into development.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

6  OUTLOOK  
 
With the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition on April 15, 2025, Discovery has transformed into a diversified 
North American -focused precious metals producer combining growing gold production in Northern Ontario, 
Canada, with one of the world’s largest sil ver development projects in Chihuahua State, Mexico. Beginning in 
the second quarter of 2025, the Company will report gold production from the Hoyle Pond and Borden 
underground mines, as well as from the ramp up of gold production from the Pamour open -pit project.  
 
Key priorities for the Porcupine Operations over the balance of 2025 include:  
• Implementing investment plans aimed at growing mining rates , increasing production levels and 
lowering unit costs at Hoyle Pond and Borden ; 
• Ensuring the successful ramp up of production at Pamou r; 
• Completing work at Dome to evaluate the large Inferred Mineral Resource and t he potential to resume 
mining operations ; and, 
• Advancing numerous exploration opportunities at each of the operating sites, as well as at  regional 
targets.  
 
In addition, the Company plans to complete sufficient work during 2025 to file a pre -feasibility study (“PFS”) for 
the Porcupine Operations with an effective date of December 31, 2025. The PFS is expected to include 
performance guidance measures for 2026. During 2025, the Company is focused on completing the transition 
process,  including optimizing management structures , integrating systems and commencing investment and 
exploration programs.  
 
As of the date of this MD&A, the Company is well capitalized to fund growth and optimization plans for 
Porcupine and current expenditure plans at Cordero with total cash  of approximately $250 million, and an 
undrawn US$100 million Debt Facility. The current cash position mainly reflects the addition  of US$475 million 
of cash through the recently completed royalty and equity financings, net of  the US$200 million cash 
consideration paid for Porcupine at closing, transaction and other related costs and cash co llateral required for 
closure obligation bonding requirements.  
 
Through the issuance of common shares  to Newmont as equity consideration for the Porcupine Acquisition, as 
well as the issuance of 275 million common shares to holders of the Subscription Receipts through the Public 
Offering , the Company’s total common shares outstanding increased from 400.5 million at December 31, 2024 
to approximately 801.4  million as at  the date of this MD&A.  
 
In Mexico, f ollowing release of the  Cordero  FS, the Company  has conducted a limited work program aimed at 
further advancing and de -risking the Project . The program has include d engineering and design work, additional 
permitting, the acquisition or lease of additional surface rights where appropriate, and the continuation of the 
Company’s ESG and community outreach programs.  
 
With the completion of the land acquisition program in March 2025, the next major milestone for the Cordero 
will be approval of the Company’s Environmental Impact Assessment  or MIA  by SEMARNAT, which was 
submitted in August 2023. The MIA passed SEMARNAT’s legal review soon after its submission and was 
advanced for technical review. As of the date of this MD&A, the Company had yet to receive a ruling on the 
technical review of the MIA . Based on favourable developments in Mexico since President Claudia Sheinbaum DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

investment projects and the mining industry to the country’s economy, the Company remains confident that 
Cordero will receive MIA approval.

Q1 2025 Compared to Q1 2024 
 
Net loss and total comprehensive loss  
 
The Company had a total comprehensive loss of $ 8,395,735  during Q 1 2025, compared to a total comprehensive 
gain  of $ 1,118,080 for Q1 2024 . The total comprehensive loss for Q1 2025  includes a non -cash currency 
translation adjustment (“CTA”) gain  of $861,766  from the translation of Discovery’s Mexican subsidiaries MXP 
functional currency financial statements to the Company’s reporting currency of CAD on consolidation  (Q1 2024

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
8  currency balances in USD or MXP compared to the CAD during the period, primarily impacting the mineral 
property balances.  
 
The increase  in net loss during Q1 2025  compared to Q1 2024  is primarily due primarily to $5,014,243  in business 
development expenses  incurred  for the evaluation of the  Porcupine  Complex . 
 
Exploration and project evaluation expense  
 
The Company incur red exploration and project evaluation costs  during Q1 2025  of $5,170, while  $153,447  was

primarily related to the acquisition of the Porcupine Complex .  
 
Interest income  
 
The Company earned  interest income of $ 216,656  during Q1 2025  compared to $699,881  during Q1 2024 . The 
lower interest is due to a lower average cash balance on hand during the period and therefore a lower total 
being invested in  interest -bearing instruments . 
 
Foreign exchange gain  
 
The company  realized  a foreign exchange  gain of $182,512  during Q1 2025  compared to a gain of $1,976,289  
during Q1 2024 . This foreign exchange gain was primarily due to changes in  MXP and USD rates  against the 
Canadian Dollar.  
 
Financial Position at  March 31, 2025  
 
The Company’s financial position changed from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 primarily as a result of the following

and deficit). The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to support the Company’s main activities of 
identifying, defining and developin g mineral deposits, thus creating shareholder value, as well as ensuring that 
the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.   
 
The Company manages its capital structure to maximize its financial flexibility  to enable the Company to 
respond to changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying assets a s well as possible 
business opportunities. The Company does not presently utilize any quantitative measures to monitor its capital 
but rather relies on the expertise of the Company’s management . Management reviews its capital management 
approach on an ongoing basis . As at March 31, 2025 , the Company does not have any long -term debt 
outstanding , and is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements or debt covenants.  
 
As part of the Financing Package, the Company entered into an agreement with Franco Nevada for a USD$100 
million Term Loan Facility which remains undrawn at the date of this MD&A.  
 
At March 31, 2025 , the Company had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities  from the 
Statement of Financial Position in the Consolidated Financial Statements ) of $11,212,723  (December 31, 202 4 – 
$24,397,11 6).

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
12  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  AND FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS  
 
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable and deposits, and accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities.  
 
Accounts receivable and deposits are classified as receivables and are measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and 
are measured at amortized cost. These financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short -
term nature.  
 
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and 
information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties 
and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in 
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 
Financial instruments are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the degree 
to which the inputs used in the fair value measurement are observable.  
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or 
indirectly; and  
Level 3  Inputs that are not based on observable market data.  
 
At March 31, 2025  the Company had no financial instruments classified as Level 2 or 3.   
 
Financial Risk Factors  
 
The Company is exposed to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and 
price risk. The aim of the Company’s overall risk management strategy is to reduce the potential adverse effect 
that these risks may have on the Company’s financial position and results. The Company’s B oard of Directors 
has overall responsibility and oversight of management’s risk management practices. Risk management is 
carried out by the Board through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the policies being 
recommended for approval by the Board of Directors at least annually or when changes are required.  
 
a) Liquidity risk  
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
financial liabilities. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. At March 31 , 202 5, the Company had a cash and cash 
equivalents balance of $15,115,274  (December 31, 202 4 – $29,310,579 ) to settle current liabilities of 
$7,977,528  (December 31, 202 4 – $8,607,312 ). The Company’s financial liabilities have contractual  
maturities of less than 30 days and are subject to normal trade terms.   
 
At March 31, 2025 , the Company has no sources of revenue to fund its operating and development 
expenditures  and has historically relied solely on non-brokered private placements to fund its operations. 
The Company’s cash balance at March 31, 2025  is sufficient to  fund  the 2025 work  program  related to 
current operations as well as the existing administrative needs. The Company may require additional 
financing to accomplish long -term strategic objectives. Future funding may be obtained by means of an DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

13  equity or debt financing  (refer to note 22 “Events after the reporting period” for an update on equity and 
debt financing) . 
 
b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to fulfill an obligation and cause the 
other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short -term investments, 
accounts receivable and prepaids and deposits are exposed to credit risk. The Company has assessed the 
credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and short -term investments as low as its funds are held in 
several highly rated Canadian financial institutions.  
 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk related to certain financial instruments as identified 
below, approximates the carrying value of these assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of 
financial position.

Deposits   96,75 6  114,501  
 $ 15,267,17 8 $ 29,507,976  
 
c) Market Risks  
 
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity prices.  
 
i. Interest rate risk  
 
The Company has significant cash balances and no interest -bearing debt. The Company’s current 
policy is to invest excess cash in high -yield savings accounts or other highly liquid interest -
bearing short -term investments. The Company regularly monitors its cash management policy.  
 
ii. Foreign currency risk  
 
The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. At March 31, 2025 , cash balances 
were held primarily in Canadian and US dollars. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value 
of the Company’s financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies will fluctuate due to 
changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in th e exchange rate between foreign currencies 
and the Canadian dollar could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows. The Co mpany does not currently use derivative 
instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, however exchange rates are 
continually monitored for any significant changes. A portion of the Company’s exploration 
expenses are paid in USD, and over the  past two years the Company converted a portion of its 
CAD cash balances into USD to reduce its currency risk exposure related to the CAD.

MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March 31, 2025  and 2024  
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
14  The Company is mainly exposed to foreign currency risk on financial instruments (consisting of 
trade payables) denominated in USD and MXP.  At March 31, 2025  and December 31, 20 24, the 
Company had the following foreign currency denominated trade payables :  
 
 March 31,  December 31,  
  2025  2024 
United States dollar  $ 3,795,463  $ 3,798,895  
Mexican Peso   912,658   898,268  
 $ 4,708,121  $ 4,697,163  
 
It is estimated that a 10% fluctuation in the United States Dollar and Mexican Peso against the 
Canadian Dollar would affect net loss at March 31 , 202 5 by approximately $470,812  (December  
31, 20 24 - $469,716 ). 
 
iii. Price risk  
 
The Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices and prices of equity 
securities. Equity security price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact on the Company’s 
net income or loss due to movements in individual prices of equity  securities or price movements 
in the stock market generally. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact 
on net income or loss and economic value due to commodity price movement and volatility. The 
Company closely monitors commodity pr ices, particularly as they relate to base and precious 
metals, and movements in the price of individual equity securities, and movements in the stock 
market generally, to assist in determining the appropriate course of action to be taken by the 
Company.  
 
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
 
The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high -risk nature of its business, which is the 
acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties. Additional risks not currently known 
to the Company, or that the Company curre ntly deems immaterial, may also impair the Company’s operations. 
If any of these risks occur, including the financial risks described above, the Company’s business, financial 
condition and operating results could be adversely affected.   
 
Key risks are described below. For a detailed discussion of risks, refer to the Company’s annual MD&A and 
Annual Information Form (“AIF”) for the year ended December 31, 202 4 available on the Company’s website.  
 
This MD&A also contains forward -looking information that involve s risks and uncertainties. The Company’s 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward -looking statements as a result of 
the risks faced by the Company as described in the documents incorporated by reference herein. Refer to  the 
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Information”.

15  Risks Relating to the Porcupine  Complex  Acquisition  
 
Potential Dispute with First Nations Community Could Have Adverse Consequences Following the Porcupine 
Acquisition Closing  
 
In November 2024, the Taykwa Tagmou Nation ("TTN") filed a Statement of Claim against His Majesty the King 
in Right of Ontario represented by the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources ("Ministry 
of Mines") and the Ministry of Environme nt, Conservation and Parks (the "Ministry of the Environment"), GCL, 
and Newmont Corporation, claiming the Crown failed to protect TTN's lands and way of life from the impacts 
of mining in the Treaty No. 9 area, particularly, the Ministry of Mines and Mini stry of Environment issued ten 
authorizations (the "Authorizations") enabling GCL to resume open pit mining at the Pamour mine after 15 years 
of closure without consulting TTN or considering the impacts to TTN's Treaty rights (the "TTN Litigation"). 
Furthe r, the Ministry of Mines accepted the GDC’s Closure Plan Amendment for filing, allowing the Pamour 
mine to reopen without consulting TTN, which TTN alleges breached the Mining Act and section 35 of the 
Constitution Act . In the Statement of Claim, TTN sough t certain relief including staying activities under the 
Authorizations issued to GDC until the Action in the Statement of Claim is heard, a declaration the Crown 
breached its constitutional duty to meaningful consult and accommodate TTN respecting the Auth orizations 
and the Crown violated Treaty No. 9 by issuing the Authorizations, quashing certain of the Authorizations, 
requiring the Crown to cooperate with TTN on various matters and seeking certain damages. TTN had previously 
brought an application for Ju dicial Review in July 2023 requesting relief respecting three of the mining 
exploration permits issued to the Seller. In January 2025, Newmont Corporation and the Seller filed a Notice of 
Intent to Defend with respect to this Action. His Majesty the King i n Right of Ontario also filed a Notice of Intent 
to Defend in November 2024. The Company  believes this claim is without merit.  
 
The outcome of this claim is uncertain and could result in delays, additional costs, or modifications to the 
Pamour mine, difficulty in obtaining financing and permits and difficulty in community relations. This claim, 
depending upon its pendency and resol ution, may give rise to material adverse effects on the Company 's 
financial condition, operations, and prospects following the Porcupine Acquisition Closing.  
 
Unexpected Liabilities Related to the Porcupine Acquisition  
In connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, there may be liabilities including environmental liabilities 
associated with the Porcupine Complex that the Company  failed to discover or was unable to quantify in the 
due diligence which it conducted in connection with the Porcupine Acquisition and the Company  may not be 
indemnified for some or all of these liabilities. Following the Porcupine Acquisition Closing, the Co mpany  may 
discover that it has acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities. The discovery of any material liabilities, or the 
inability to obtain full indemnification for such liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company 's 
business, financial condition or future prospects. While the Co mpany  has estimated these potential liabilities 
for the purposes of making its decision to enter into the Porcupine Acquisition Agreement, there can be no 
assurance that any resulting liability including environmental liabilities will not exceed the Co mpany 's estimates.  
In addition, the Co mpany  may be unable to retain Porcupine's employees following the Porcupine Acquisition. 
The continuing and collaborative efforts of the Porcupine Complex's employees are important to its success and 
its business would be harmed if it were to lose their service s.  
 
The existence of undisclosed liabilities and the Co mpany 's inability to retain the Porcupine Complex's employees 
could have an adverse impact on the Co mpany 's business, financial condition and results of operations.

16  Nature of Acquisitions  
Acquisitions of mineral properties are based in large part on  engineering, environmental and economic 
assessments made by the acquiror, independent engineers and consultants. These assessments include a series 
of assumptions regarding such factors as operational performance, status of and impact of policy, legislati on 
and regulations and effective tax rates. Many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond Discovery's 
control. All such assessments involve a measure of engineering, environmental and regulatory uncertainty that 
could result in lower revenue o r higher operating or capital expenditures than anticipated.  
 
Information Provided by GCL  
Information related to the Porcupine Complex in this MD&A  is based on information provided by GCL. Although 
the Company  has conducted what it believes to be a prudent and thorough level of investigation with respect 
to the Porcupine Complex in connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, a certain degree of risk remains 
regarding the accuracy and completeness of such information. While the Company  has no reason to believe the 
information obtained from GCL is misleading, untrue or incomplete, the Company  cannot assure the accuracy 
or completeness of such information, nor can the Company  compel GCL to disclose events which may have 
occurred or may affect the completeness or accuracy of such information, but which are unknown to the 
Company . 
 
Failure to Realize Porcupine Acquisition Benefits  
There is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition may fail to materialize or 
may not occur within the time periods that Discovery anticipates. The realization of such benefits may be 
affected by a number of factors, man y of which are beyond the control of the Company . 
 
Moreover, a variety of factors, including those risk factors set forth in this AIF, may adversely affect the 
Company 's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition.  
 
Integration of the Porcupine Complex  
Although the Company  expects to realize certain benefits as a result of the Porcupine Acquisition, there is a 
possibility that, following the Porcupine Acquisition, the Company  is unable to successfully integrate the 
Porcupine Complex into its operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition 
or may be unable to do so within the anticipated timeframe.  
 
The Company  expects to implement certain operational improvements and cost -savings initiatives following the 
completion of the Porcupine Acquisition. Any cost -savings that the Company  realizes from such efforts may 
differ materially from the Company 's estimates. In addition, any cost -savings that the Company  realizes may be 
offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in other expenses. The Company 's 
operational improvements and cost -savings plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may 
change at any time.  
 
To effectively integrate the Porcupine Complex into its current operations, Discovery must establish appropriate 
operational, administrative, finance, and management systems and controls functions relating to the Porcupine 
Complex. These efforts, together with the ongoing integration following the Porcupine Acquisition, will require 
substantial attention from Discovery's management. This diversion of management attention, as well as any 
other difficulties which Discovery may encounter in completing the Acqu isition and integration process, could 
have an adverse effect on Discovery's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There 
can be no assurance that Discovery will be successful in integrating the Porcupine Complex or that the expected 
benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition will be realized.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
17  Discovery Will Rely on GCL Following Completion of the Porcupine Acquisition for Certain Services  
In connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, Discovery and GCL agreed to enter into the Transition Services 
Agreement upon the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition pursuant to which GCL has agreed to provide, or cause 
its affiliates to provide, certain se rvices to Discovery that are required for the operation of the Porcupine 
Complex in a similar manner as the Porcupine Complex was operated immediately prior to the Porcupine 
Acquisition Closing. As a result, Discovery will be reliant on GCL’s personnel, go od faith, contractual compliance, 
expertise and judgment in providing the services under the Transition Services Agreement, where the 
Company 's ability to manage operational risks may be limited. Accordingly, Discovery may be exposed to 
adverse developments in the business and affairs of GCL, its management and to its financial strength.  
 
There can be no assurance that the services provided by GCL pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement will 
be adequate for the Company  to operate the Porcupine Complex and facilitate the efficient and effective 
transition of business operations as currently contemplated, or at all. If GCL does not perform the services under 
the Transition Services Agreement as currently contemplated, the operations and financial performa nce of the 
Porcupine Complex may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, 
financial condition and future performance of the Company . If, after the expiration of the Transition Services 
Agreement, the Company  is un able to perform these services or replace them in a timely manner or on terms 
and conditions as favorable as those under the Transition Services Agreement, the Company  may experience 
operational problems and an increase in its costs.  
 
Failure by the Seller to meet its obligations under the Transition Services Agreement could have a material 
adverse effect on the operation of the Porcupine Complex , which could in turn have a material adverse effect 
on the business, financial condition and future performance of the Company . 
 
Litigation and Public Attitude towards the Porcupine Acquisition  
The Company  may be exposed to increased litigation from shareholders or other third -parties  in connection 
with the Porcupine Acquisition. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the Company 's business and 
results of operations or may cause disruptions to the Company 's operations. Even if any such claims are without 
merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert the time and resources of 
management.  
 
Furthermore, public attitudes towards the Porcupine Acquisition could result in negative press coverage and 
other adverse public statements affecting the Company . Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements 
could negatively impact the ability of the Company  to achieve the benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition or take 
advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, 
and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material ad verse effect on the Company 's 
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
 
Porcupine Acquisition and Related Costs  
The Company  incurred  significant costs associated with completing the Porcupine Acquisition and will continue 
to incur significant costs through integrating the operations of Discovery and the Porcupine Complex . The 
substantial majority of such costs are non-recurring expenses resulting from the Porcupine Acquisition and 
consist primarily of transaction costs related to the Porcupine Acquisition. Additional unanticipated costs may 
be incurred through the integration of the Porcupine Complex into Discovery's  existing business and such costs, 
if incurred, may have a negative effect on the Company 's business, operations and financial performance and 
cash flows.

18  Increased Indebtedness  
In financing the Porcupine Acquisition, Discovery may incur additional debt under the Credit Facility. Such 
borrowing, to the extent incurred, would increase Discovery's consolidated indebtedness. Such additional 
indebtedness will increase Discovery's interest expense and debt service obligations and may have a negative 
effect on Discovery's results of operations and/or credit ratings. Such increased indebtedness may also make 
Discovery's results more sensitive to increases in interest rates. Discovery's degree of leverage could have other 
important consequences for purchasers, including: (i) having a negative effect on Discovery's issuer debt rating; 
(ii) it may limit Disc overy's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt 
service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; (iii) it may limit Discovery's ability 
to declare dividends on the Common Shares; (iv ) Discovery may be vulnerable in a downturn in general 
economic conditions; and (v) Discovery may be unable to make capital expenditures that are important to its 
growth and strategies.  
 
Risk of Default in the Repayment of Borrowing under the Franco -Nevada Financing Package  
The Company  has secured the Franco -Nevada Financing Package which includes debt financing pursuant to the 
Credit Facility. In the event Discovery draws on the Credit Facility, Discovery may repay all or a portion of such 
borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of  additional securities. If Discovery is unable to raise sufficient 
proceeds from such intended sale of such securities on terms acceptable to Discovery, its ability to repay 
borrowings under the Credit Facility could be adversely affected. In th e event Discovery is unable to refinance 
borrowings it may incur under the Credit Facility in the manner Discovery intends, Discovery may be required 
to utilize other sources of liquidity including cash on hand, cash from operating activities or other borr owings. 
Discovery may also be required to seek extensions to or modifications of the terms of the Credit Facility in order 
to defer the maturity dates of any borrowings incurred thereunder. Depending upon credit market conditions 
at the time when borrowing s, if any, are due for repayment, and Discovery's own financial performance at that 
time, Discovery may be unable to obtain extensions or modifications of the terms of the Credit Facility on terms 
satisfactory to Discovery, or at all, which could result in  Discovery defaulting on its repayment obligations under 
the Credit Facility and being subject to various remedies available to Franco -Nevada thereunder including 
remedies available under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency legislation.  
 
Drawdowns Under the Term Loan Agreement are Subject to a Number of Conditions  
The ability of Discovery to borrow and obtain an advance under the Term Loan Agreement is subject to the 
satisfaction of conditions precedent by Dome Mine Ltd and Discovery which may be outside of control of 
Discovery to satisfy. For the initial advance, such conditions include, but are not limited to, the lender under the 
Term Loan Agreement being satisfied with a mine plan, financial model, including demonstra ting compliance 
with financial covenants, and technical reports for the Porcupine Complex, review and due diligence on 
disclosure schedules to the Term Loan Agreement, provision by Discovery and Dome Mine Ltd of the required 
security and opinions, includin g title opinions on the Porcupine Complex, no events having occurred that would 
individually or in the aggregate have had or could reasonably have a material adverse effect, no default or event 
of default occurring, among other conditions. For all advances , in addition to the conditions for the initial 
advance, certain additional customary conditions precedent must be satisfied. The ability for Dome Mine Ltd to 
receive and access funds under the Term Loan Agreement is contingent on its ability to satisfy th e required 
conditions to advance.

For a full description of the Company’s material  accounting policies, please see note 3 of the consolidated 
financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 202 4. 
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Future Accounting Standards and Interpretations  
 
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments  (Amendment to I FRS 9 and IFRS 7 ) 
 
The amendments clarify  that financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized and derecognized at 
settlement date except for regular way purchases or sales of financial assets and financial liabilities meeting 
conditions for a new exception. The new exception permits companies to elect to derecognize certain financial 
liabilities settled via electronic payment systems earlier than the settlement date.  
 
They also provide guidelines to assess contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets, which apply to 
all contingent cash flows, including those arising from environmental, social, and governance ESG  linked 
features. Additionally, these amendments introduce new disclosure requirements and update others.  
 
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 6. The impact of these 
amendments on the Company’s financial statements has not yet been evaluated . 
 
Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”)  
 
IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1  – Presentation of Financial Statements , which sets out presentation and base disclosure 
requirements for financial statements. The changes, which mostly affect the income statement, include the 
requirement to classify income and expenses into three new categories – operating, investing and fin ancing – 
and present subtotals for operating profit or loss and profit or loss before financing and income taxes.  
 
Further, operating expenses are presented directly on the face of the income statement – classified either by 
nature (e.g. employee compensation), by function (e.g. cost of sales) or using a mixed presentation. Expenses 
presented by function require more detailed disclosures about their nature.  
 
IFRS 18 also provides enhanced guidance for aggregation and disaggregation of information in the financial 
statements, introduces new disclosure requirements for management -defined performance measures 
(“MPMs ”) and eliminates classification options for interest and dividends in the statement of cash flows.  Non-
GAAP measures that meet the definition of MPMs will be subject to the disclosure requirements

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
20  This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 7. The impact of these 
amendments on the Company’s financial statements has not yet been evaluated . 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS  Accounting Standards requires 
man agement to make estimates, judg ments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results could differ from these 
estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected .  
 
Information about critical judgments and estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most  
significant effect on the amounts recognized in the interim financial statements for the three  months  ended  
March 31 , 2025, are consistent with those applied and disclosed in note 5 of the annual C onsolidated  Financial 
Statements  for the year ended December 31, 2024 . The Company's interim results are not necessarily indicative 
of its results for a full  year.  
 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
 
The Company does not have any off -balance sheet arrangements.  
 
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION  
 
Scientific and technical Information in this Circular with respect to the Company’s Cordero project has been 
prepared and presented based on the technical report entitled  “Cordero Silver Project, Technical Report & 
Feasibility Study”  with an effective date of February 16, 2024, available on the Company’s SEDAR+ profile at 
www.sedarplus.ca , and such scientific and technical information is subject to the assumptions and qualifications 
contained in the said technical report.  
Scientific and technical Information in this Circular with respect to the Company’s Porcupine complex has been 
prepared and presented based on the technical report entitled  “Porcupine Complex, Ontario, Canada, NI 43 -
101 Technical Report on Preliminary Economic Assessment”  with an effective date of January 13, 2025, available 
on the Company’s SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca , and such scientific and technical information is subject 
to the assumptions and qualifications contained in the said technical report.  The Technical Report includes the 
results of a preliminary economic assessment which is preliminary in nature. It includes Inferred Mineral 
Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them 
that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves and there is no certainty that the estimates will 
be realized.  
 
The scientific and  technical information in this MD&A was reviewed and approved by  Pierre Rocque, P.Eng., 
Chief Operating Officer of the Company and  Gernot Wober , P. Geo. , Vice President Exploration  of the Company,

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
21  MANAGEMENT’S  REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
 
The Canadian Securities Administrators have issued National Instrument 52 -109 - Certification of Disclosure in 
Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (“NI 52 -109”) which requires public companies in Canada to submit annual 
and interim certificates relating to  the design and effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures that 
are in use at the Company. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported on a timely basis to senior 
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to enable this 
information to be reviewed and discussed so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding the timely public 
disclosure of th e information. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure 
controls and procedures and has concluded that they were effective as at March 31, 2025 .  
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
NI 52 -109 also requires public companies in Canada to submit interim and annual certificates relating to the 
design of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and an annual certificate that includes evaluating the 
operating effectiveness of ICFR. The Company’s ICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with IFRS  Accounting Standards . Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining ICFR. The 
Company used the 2013 Commission of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) 
framework as the basis for designing its ICFR. Due to its inherent limitations, ICFR may  not prevent or detect 
misstatements on a timely basis as such systems can only be designed to provide reasonable as opposed to 
absolute assurance. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of ICFR to future periods are subject 
to the risk t hat the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. There have been no significant changes in the 
Company’s internal controls during the three months end ed March 31, 2025  that have materially affected, or 
are reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. The individuals performing the duties of the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have each evaluated the operating effective ness of the 
Company’s ICFR as at March 31, 2025  and have concluded that the ICFR are effective.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
24  CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS CONCERNING ESTIMATES OF MEASURED, INDICATED, 
AND INFERRED RESOURCES  
 
Information in this MD&A , including any information incorporated by reference, and disclosure documents of 
Discovery that are filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities concerning mineral properties have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the 
requirements of United States securities laws.  
 
Without limiting the foregoing, these documents use the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources”, 
and “inferred resources”. Shareholders in the United States are advised that, while such terms are defined in 
and required by Canadian securities law s, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) 
does not recognize them. Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve 
unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economical ly and legally produced or 
extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume 
that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred 
resource s have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally 
or economically. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to 
indicated mineral resources with continue d exploration; however, there is no certainty that these inferred 
mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Under 
Canadian rules inferred mineral resources must not be included in the economic anal ysis, production schedules, 
or estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre -Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and 
cash flow models of developed mines. Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in economic studies as 
provid ed under NI 43 -101. These standards are similar to, but differ in some ways from, the requirements of 
the SEC that are applicable to domestic United States reporting companies and foreign private issuers not 
eligible for the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Any mineral reserves and mineral resources reported by 
the Company  in accordance with NI 43 -101 may not qualify as such under SEC standards under Subpart 1300 of 
Regulation S -K. Therefore, United States investors are also cautioned not to assume th at all or any part of the 
inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. Disclosure of contained ounces is 
permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report 
resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information 
concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in these documents may not be comparable 
to information made public by United States companies subject  to the reporting and disclosure requirements 
of the SEC.  
 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND NON -GAAP MEASURES  
 
Discovery has prepared its consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, in accordance 
with IFRS Accounting Standards . As a result, they may not be comparable to financial statements prepared in 
accordance with other financial reporting frameworks, including generally accept ed accounting principles used 
in the US (“GAAP ”). 
 
The Company  has included certain non -GAAP performance measures and ratios as detailed below. In the mining 
industry, these are common performance measures and ratios but may not be comparable to similar measures 
or ratios presented by other issuers and the non -GAAP measures and ratios do not have any standardized 
meaning. Accordingly, these measures and ratios are included  to provide additional information and should not 
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS  
Accounting Standards . Total cash costs per ounce, all -in sustaining costs, and free cash flow, are all forward -DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March 31, 2025  and 2024  
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
25  looking non -GAAP financial measures or ratios. As the Cordero Project is not in production, these prospective 
non-GAAP financial measures or ratios may not be reconciled to the nearest comparable measure under IFRS  
Accounting Standards  and there is no equivalent historical non -GAAP financial measure or ratio for these 
prospective non -GAAP financial measures  or ratios . Each non -GAAP financial measure and ratio used herein is 
described in more detail below.  
 
Total Cash Costs  
 
The Company  calculated total cash costs per silver equivalent (“AgEq”) payable ounce by dividing the sum of 
operating costs, royalty costs, production taxes, refining and shipping costs, net of by -product silver credits, by 
payable ounces. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company  
believes that this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance.  
 
The Company calculated total cash costs per gold payable ounce as the sum of the mining, processing and 
general and administrative operating costs, change in inventory, royalty payments and treatment and refining 
costs. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company believes that 
this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance.  
 
All-in Sustaining Costs  and All -in Sustaining Costs per Metal  Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  has provided an all -in sustaining costs performance measure that reflects all the expenditures 
that are  required to produce an ounce of silver from operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the 
measure across the industry, the Company ’s definition conforms to the all -in sustaining cost definition as set 
out by the World Gold Council in its updated G uidance Note issued in 2018 . The Company  believes that this 
measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the Company ’s ability to generate 
free cash flow from current operations. Subsequent amendments to the guidance have not materially affected 
the figures presented.  
 
AISC per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce is calculated as: [Operating costs (mining, processing and G&A) + 
Royalties + Concentrate Transportation + Treatment & Refining Charges + Concentrate Penalties + Sustaining 
Capital (excluding $37M of capex for the initial purchase of mining fleet in Year 1 )] / Payable AgEq ounces.  
 
AISC per Gold Payable Ounce is calculated as: [Operating costs (mining, processing and G&A) + Royalties + 
Concentrate Transportation + Treatment & Refining Charges + change in inventory + reclamation accretion + 
exploration expenses + Sustaining Capital] /  Payable gold ounces.  
 
Free Cash Flow  
 
Free Cash Flow is a non -GAAP performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash 
flows invested in mineral property, plant, and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets. The Company  
believes that this measure is useful to the external users in assessing the Company ’s ability to generate cash 
flows from its mineral projects.
