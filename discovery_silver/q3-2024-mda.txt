DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
 
The Company ’s Common Shares are listed on the T oronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”)  under the symbol “DSV”, on 
the OTCQX under the symbol “DSVSF”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “1CU0”.  
 
Discovery’s flagship asset is the 100% -owned Cordero silver project (“Cordero” or the “Cordero Project” ) located 
in Chihuahua State, Mexico. The Cordero Project has all the attributes of a quality project: grade, scale, 
significant organic growth opportunities, and well located in mining -friendly Chihuahua state on a prolific silver 
belt. Since acquiring Co rdero in August 2019, Discovery’s focus has been on defining the economic potential of 
the Cordero Project primarily through two extensive drill programs and two detailed metallurgical testwork 
programs. Following the completion of a Feasibility Study titl ed the “Cordero Silver Project: NI 43 -101 Technical 
Report & Feasibility Study (Chihuahua State, Mexico) ” (the “FS”) with an effective date of February 16, 2024 ,

4  CORDERO OVERVIEW  
 
Highlights  
 
On April 1, 2024, the Company announced  the filing of its National Instrument 43 -101 (“NI 43 -101”) technical 
report entitled:  Cordero Silver Project, Technical Report & Feasibility Study  dated February 16, 2024 (the 
“Technical Report”), in respect of Discovery’s Cordero deposit in Mexico. The report was authored by Ausenco 
Engineering Canada ULC, with support from AGP Mining Consultants Inc., WSP USA Environment and 
Infrastructure Inc. an d RedDot3D Inc.  
 
Highlights include:  
• Large -scale, long -life production:  19-year mine life with  an average of 37 million ounces (“Moz”) of silver 
equivalent (“AgEq”)  production from  Year 1 to Year 12.  
• Low costs, high margins:  average AISC of less than USD $12.50 over the first eight years of mine life placing 
Cordero in the bottom half of the cost curve.  
• Attractive project economics:  Base Case after -tax Net Present Value at 5% (“NPV”) of USD $1.2 billion and 
IRR of 22% with NPV expanding to USD $2.2 billion in Year 4.  
• Low capital intensity:  initial development capital expenditures  (“capex”)  of USD $606 million resulting in an 
attractive after -tax NPV -to-capex ratio of 2.0.  
• Tier 1 reserve base:  Reserves of silver (“Ag”)  - 302 Moz, gold (“Au”)  - 840 thousand ounces (“koz”) , lead 
(“Pb”)  – 3.0 billion pounds (BIb)  and zinc (“Zn”)  – 5.2 Blb, positioning Cordero as one of the largest 
undeveloped silver deposits globally.  
• Clear upside potential:  240 million tonnes (“Mt”)  of Measured & Indicated Resource sit outside the FS pit 
highlighting the potential to materially extend the mine life at modestly higher silver prices.  
• Substantial socio -economic contribution:  an initial investment of USD $606 million, 2,500 jobs created 
during construction, USD $4.0 billion of goods  and services purchased and estimated tax contributions of 
over USD $1.4 billion within Mexico.  
• Environmental standards:  third -party reviews of proposed environmental practices to ensure adherence 
to both Mexican regulatory standards and Equator Principles 4. The Study also incorporates investment in 
infrastructure and technology to recycle wastewater from local communities  with discharged water 
representing the primary source of water for mine operations.  
Project Economics  
 
The economics for the FS were based on the following metal prices: Ag - $22.00/oz, Au - $1,600/oz, Pb - $1.00/lb 
and Zn - $1.20/lb  A 10% increase in metal prices results in a 40% increase in the Project NPV to over USD$1,647 
million. At metal prices as at November 1 1, 2024, the NPV would total USD$ 2,134 million , an 81% increase over 
the FS Project NPV. The FS payback  at base case prices  is 5.2 years due to the expansion of the processing plant 
from 26,000 tpd to 51,000 tpd in Year 3 at a capital cost of USD $291 million. This expansion is expected to be 
funded from operating cash flow.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

Resource Update  
 
In conjunction with the FS, the Mineral Resource Estimate for Cordero was updated to incorporate an additional 
34,957 m of drilling in 103 holes since the release of the Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”)  (Mineral Resource 
Estimate now includes total drilling of 310,861 m in 793 drill holes). The Measured & Indicated Resource has 
grown by 70 Moz AgEq to 1,203 Moz AgEq with the Inferred Resource being reduced by 13 Moz AgEq to 154 
Moz AgEq as summarized bel ow. The overall expansion of the resource was lar gely driven by exploration success 
at depth and in the northeast part of the deposit.  
• Measured & Indicated Resource of 1,203 Moz AgEq at an average grade of 52 g/t AgEq  (719 Mt grading 
21 g/t Ag, 0.06 g/t Au, 0.30% Pb and 0.57% Zn)  
• Inferred Resource of 154 Moz AgEq at an average grade of 33 g/t AgEq  (148 Mt grading 14 g/t Ag, 0.02 g/t 
Au, 0.18% Pb and 0.35% Zn)  
 
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
 
OUTLOOK  
 
Following release  of the FS, the Company has execut ed a work program in 2024 aimed at further advancing and 
de-risking the Cordero Project. The program includes engineering and design work, additional permitting, the 
acquisition or lease of additional surface rights where appropriate, further exploration wor k and the 
continuation of the Company’s ESG and community outreach programs as it works through the permitting 
process.  
 
The two principal environmental permits required for the construction, operation and closure of Cordero are: 
the Environmental Impact Assessment (“Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental” or “MIA”); and the Change of 
Land Use (“Cambio de Uso de Suelo” or “CUS”) . Both permits are subject to review and approval by the 
Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”), Mexico’s federal agency for natural 
resources and the environment.  
The Company formally submitted for evaluation its MIA in August 2023. The MIA passed SEMARNAT’s legal 
review soon after its submission  and was advanced for technical review. In March 2024, SEMARNAT issued a 
notice for a 60 -day extension to the technical review period, which extended the review to late June 2024. As 
at November 12, 2024, the Company had yet to receive a ruling on the tech nical review of the MIA.  
The CUS submission is supported by a Change of Land Use Study known as an Estudio Tecnico Justificativo 
(“ETJ”). Compilation of the ETJ by the Company and third -party is nearing completion with formal submission 
of the CUS expected early in 2025.

6  In addition to technical, permitting and ESG work being completed in 2024 to further progress Cordero, the 
Company is also advanc ing all financing options for the Project. These options include equity, debt, offtake, joint 
ventures, partnerships, lease financing on major equipment, streams, royalties and other strategic alternatives.  
The Company is well positioned to finance the 2024 work program with a cash position of approximately $32  
million  as at November 12 , 2024, and no debt.

8  IVA receivable  
 
The Company’s Mexican subsidiaries pay value -added tax, Impuesto  al Valor Agregado (“IVA”) on the purchase 
of goods and services. The amount of IVA paid is recoverable but subject to review and assessment by the 
Mexican tax authority (“SAT”). The complex application process and detailed review by SAT can impact the 
collectability and timing of refunds.  
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed an in -person audit with SAT and 
received a net refund of $8.0 million, including interest and inflationary adjustments less legal fees. This refund 
was for a cumulative five -year return  filed with SAT in 2022, for months beginning August 2017 through May 
2022 (the “Cumulative Refund”). The favourable assessment provided the Company with greater confidence on 
future IVA collection. All prior provisions recorded against the IVA receivable balance were reversed in 2023.  
 
The Company classifies the IVA receivable balance as current or non -current based on the estimated timing of 
collection from SAT. Any returns deemed collectible within 12 months are recorded as a current receivable 
while any IVA estimated to be collectible  after 12 months is recorded as a non -current receivable.  During Q2 
2024, the company received a refund of approximately $250,000 including interest. As at September  30, 2024, 
the Company had recorded $ 2,930,878  and $ 2,328,02 4 as current and non -current IV A receivables in the 
Statement of Financial Position.

was for a cumulative five -year return  filed with SAT in 2022, for months beginning August 2017 through May 
2022 (the “Cumulative Refund”). The favourable assessment provided the Company with greater confidence on 
future IVA collection. All prior provisions recorded against the IVA receivable balance were reversed in 2023.  
 
The Company classifies the IVA receivable balance as current or non -current based on the estimated timing of 
collection from SAT. Any returns deemed collectible within 12 months are recorded as a current receivable 
while any IVA estimated to be collectible  after 12 months is recorded as a non -current receivable.  During Q2 
2024, the company received a refund of approximately $250,000 including interest. As at September  30, 2024, DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

$48,741,556 from the market public offering equity raise completed during April 2023.  
 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  AND LIQUIDITY  
 
The Company defines capital as its shareholder’s equity (comprised of issued share capital, contributed surplus 
and deficit). The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to support the Company’s main activities of 
identifying, defining , and developing mineral deposits, with the goal of creating shareholder value, as well 
ensuring that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.   
 
The Company manages its capital structure to maximize its financial flexibility to enable the Company to 
respond to changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets and business 
opportunities. Management reviews its capi tal management approach on an ongoing basis and believes that 
this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable. The current excess funds realized from the 
non-brokered private placements are invested in highly liquid, interest -bearing m arketable securities with no 
restrictions on redemption.   
 
At September 30, 202 4, the Company does not have any long -term debt outstanding and is not subject to any 
externally imposed capital requirements or debt covenants. There was no change to the Company’s approach 
to capital management during the  three  and nine  months  ended September  30, 202 4.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  AND FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS  
 
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable and deposits, and accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities.  
 
Accounts r eceivable  and deposits  are classified as receivables and are measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. Accounts  payable  and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and 
are measured at amortized cost. These financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short -
term nature.  
 
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and 
information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties 
and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in 
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 
Financial instruments are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the degree 
to which the inputs used in the fair value measurement are observable.  
 
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or 
indirectly; and  
Level 3  Inputs that are not based on observable market data.  
 
At September  30, 202 4 the Company had no financial instruments classified as Level 2 or 3.   
 
Financial Risk Factors  
 
The Company is exposed to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and 
price risk. The aim of the Company’s overall risk management strategy is to reduce the potential adverse effect 
that these risks may have on the Company’s financial position and results. The Company’s Board of Directors 
has overall responsibility and oversight of management’s risk m anagement practices. Risk management is 
carried out by the Board through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the policies being 
recommended for approval by the Board of Directors at least annually or when changes are required.  
 
a) Liquidity risk  
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
financial liabilities. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. At September  30, 2024, the Company had a cash and cash DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE  AND NINE  MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
13  equivalents balance of $33,442,223  (December 31, 2023 – $58,944,459) to settle current liabilities of 
$6,224,929  (December  31, 2023 – $12,168,225). The Company’s financial liabilities have contractual 
maturities of less than 30 days and are subject to normal trade terms, with the exception of the final 
installment for the land acquisition  which has a contractual maturity greater than 30 days and is due in 
May 2025 . 
 
At September  30, 202 4, the Company has no sources of revenue to fund its operating and development 
expenditures and has historically relied solely on non -brokered private placements to fund its operations. 
The Company’s current cash balance is sufficient to fund the 202 4 work program as well as the existing 
administrative needs. The Company may require additional financing to accomplish long -term strategic 
objectives.  
 
b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to fulfill an obligation and cause the 
other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short -term investments, 
accounts receivable and prepaids and d eposits are exposed to credit risk. The Company has assessed the 
credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and short -term investments as low as its funds are held in 
several highly rated Canadian financial institutions.  
 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk related to certain financial instruments as identified 
below, approximates the carrying value of these assets on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated 
statements of financial position.  
 
 September  30, December 31,  
  2024  2023 
Cash and cash equivalents  $ 33,442,223  $ 58,944,459  
Other receivables   136,662   237,086  
Deposits   89,572   130,504  
 $ 33,668,457  $ 59,312,049  
 
c) Market Risks  
 
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity prices.   
 
i. Interest rate risk  
 
The Company has significant cash balances and no interest -bearing debt. The Company’s current 
policy is to invest excess cash in high -yield savings accounts or other highly liquid interest -
bearing short -term investments. The Company regularly monitors its cash management policy.  
  
ii. Foreign currency risk  
 
The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. At September  30, 202 4, cash balances 
were held primarily in Canadian and US dollars. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value 
of the Company’s financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies will fluctuate due to DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE  AND NINE  MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
14  changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies 
and the Canadian dollar could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows. The Company does not currently us e derivative 
instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, however exchange rates are 
continually monitored for any significant changes. A portion of the Company’s exploration 
expenses are paid in USD, and over the past two years the Company  converted a portion of its 
CAD cash balances into USD to reduce its currency risk exposure related to the CAD.  
 
The Company is mainly exposed to foreign currency risk on financial instruments (consisting of 
trade payables) denominated in USD and MXP.   
 
The Company had the following foreign currency denominated trade payables  and accrued 
liabilities :  
 
 September  30, December 31,  
  2024  2023 
United States dollar  $ 3,382,377  $ 6,991,862  
Mexican Peso   713,316   806,771  
 $ 4,095,693  $ 7,798,633  
 
It is estimated that a 10% fluctuation in the United States Dollar and Mexican Peso against the 
Canadian Dollar would affect net loss at September  30, 2024 by approximately $409,571  
(December 31, 202 3 - $779,844 ). 
 
iii. Price risk  
 
The Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices and prices of equity 
securities. Equity security price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact on the Company’s 
net income or loss due to movements in individual prices of equity sec urities or price movements 
in the stock market generally. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact 
on net income or loss and economic value due to commodity price movement and volatility. The 
Company closely monitors commodity prices , particularly as they relate to base and precious 
metals, and movements in the price of individual equity securities, and movements in the stock 
market generally, to assist in determining the appropriate course of action to be taken by the 
Company.  
 
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
 
The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high -risk nature of its business, which is the 
acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties , primarily in Mexico . Additional risks 
not currently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair the 
Company’s operations. If any of these risks occur, including the financial risks described above, the Company’s 
business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.

FOR THE THREE  AND NINE  MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
15  Permitting and Licensing Risk  
 
The operations of the Company require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. The 
Company believes that it presently holds all necessary licenses and permits required in carrying out the activities 
which it is currently conducting under  applicable laws and regulations and the Company believes it is presently 
complying in all material respects with the terms of such licenses and permits. Further , such licenses and permits 
are subject to change in regulations and in various operating circu mstances. Further, such licenses and permits 
may be subject to governmental and regulatory changes, at both the federal and state level s in Mexico, which 
are outside the control of the Company.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain all 
necessary licenses and permits required to carry out exploration, development and mining operations at its 
project.  
 
As a result of the recent election in June of 2024, administrative changes in government offices could result in 
delays in processing applications and issuing any licenses and permits  and may result in regulatory changes 
which impact Mexico’s  mining laws . The Company currently has all necessary drill permits to complete planned 
work in 2024, however any future applications could be adversely impacted by various factors including but not 
limited to the impact of the change in government , in Mexico at various  levels and the potential delays 
associated in connection therewith . 
 
Political Risk  
 
The Company’s mineral exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by 
changing government regulations relating to the mining industry  in Mexico , including permitting, water rights, 
usage rights, or other material considerations which affect the Cordero Project, including shifts in political 
conditions that increase royalties payable or the costs related to the Company ’s activities or maintaining  and 
permitting  its properties. The occurrence of election cycles and subsequent changeover of governments at the 
federal , state  and local level, including such personnel,  in addition to mining regime changes adds uncertainties 
that cannot be accurately predicted and any future adverse changes in government policies or legislation in the 
jurisdictions in which the Company operates that affect foreign ownership, mineral expl oration, development 
or mining activities, may affect the Company’s viability and profitability. As Mexico enters into a transition 
period  since the swearing -in of the new president on October 1, 2024 , the Company cannot guarantee that the 
resulting change  in government will not have a material adverse effect on our business or the mining industry 
in the country. Current and future operations may also be affected in varying degrees by government 
regulations with respect to restrictions on production, price controls, government -imposed royalties, claim fees, 
export controls, income taxes, and expropriation of property, environmental legislation, and mine safety. There 
is furthermore the potential impact from a lack of application of regulations, leading to de lays in permitting. 
The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted. Although the Company’s exploration and 
development activities are currently carried out in material compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, 
no assurance can be gi ven that new rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing rules and 
regulations will not be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. 
Furthermore, any shift in political attitudes, or amendments to current la ws and regulations governing 
operations and activities of mining and milling or more stringent implementation thereof are beyond the control 
of the Company and could have a substantial adverse impact on the Company.  
For a detailed discussion of risks, refer to the Company’s MD&A and Annual Information Form (“AIF”) for the 
year ended December 31, 202 3 available on the Company’s website.

financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 202 3. 
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
 
The new standards, or amendments to standards and interpretations that were adopted by the Company, 
effective January 1, 202 4, are as follows:  
 
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non -Current (Amendment to IAS 1)  
 
The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine 
whether,  in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date 
should be classified as  current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non -current.  
 
The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s interim financial 
statements.  
 
Adoption of Future Accounting Standards  
 
IFRS 18 – Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements  
 
The IASB issued IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements , which is mandatory for accounting 
periods after January 1, 2027. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new IFRS Accounting 
Standard on its financial statements and will update the Company’s accounting policies as applicable.

17  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS  Accounting Standards requires 
man agement to make estimates, judg ments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results could differ from these 
estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected .  
 
Information about critical judgments and estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most  
significant effect on the amounts recognized in the interim financial statements for the three  months  ended  
September  30, 2024, are consistent with those applied and disclosed in note 5 of the annual consolidated  
financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 2023 . The Company's interim results are not necessarily 
indicative of its results for a full  year. 
 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
 
The Company does not have any off -balance sheet arrangements.  
 
QUALIFIED PERSON  
 
The technical information in this MD&A was reviewed and approved by Gernot Wober , P. Geo. , Vice President 
Exploration  of the Company, who is recognized as a Qualified Person (“QP”) under the guidelines of NI 43-101.   
 
MANAGEMENT’S  REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
 
The Canadian Securities Administrators have issued National Instrument 52 -109 - Certification  of Disclosure in 
Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (“NI 52 -109”) which requires public companies in Canada to submit annual 
and interim certificates relating to the design and effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures that 
are in use at th e Company. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported on a timely basis to senior 
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to enable this 
information to be reviewed and discussed so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding the timely public 
disclosure of th e information. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure 
controls and procedures and has concluded that they were effective as at September  30, 2024 .  
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
NI 52 -109 also requires public companies in Canada to submit interim and annual certificates relating to the 
design of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and an annual certificate that includes evaluating the 
operating effectiveness of ICFR. The Company’s ICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with IFRS  Accounting Standards . Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining ICFR. The 
Company used the 2013 Commission of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) 
framework as the basis for designing its ICFR. Due to its inherent limitations, ICFR may  not prevent or detect 
misstatements on a timely basis as such systems can only be designed to provide reasonable as opposed to DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

18  absolute assurance. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of ICFR to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or p rocedures may deteriorate. There have been no significant changes in the 
Company’s internal controls during the three months ended  September  30, 2024 that have materially affected, 
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. The individuals perfor ming the duties of the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have each evaluated the operating effectiveness of the 
Company’s ICFR as at September  30, 2024 and have concluded that the ICFR are effective.

regulatory, competitive and other risks and uncertainties, contingencies, and other factors that are not within 
the control of Discovery Silv er Corp. (“Discovery” or the “ Company ”) and could thus cause actual performance,

operations and valuation; risk related to the cyclical nature of the mining business; permitting and license risks; 
risks related to title to land and the potential acquisition of neighb oring land packages and the timing thereof; 
risks related to requiring a significant supply of water for the Company ’s operations and being able to source it; 
the availability of adequate infrastructure for the Company ’s operations; risks related to community relations;

CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS CONCERNING ESTIMATES OF 
MEASURED, INDICATED, AND INFERRED RESOURCES  
 
Information in this MD&A, including any information incorporated by reference, and disclosure documents of 
Discovery that are filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities concerning mineral properties have been DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

FOR THE THREE  AND NINE  MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
21  prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the 
requirements of United States securities laws.  
 
Without limiting the foregoing, these documents use the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources”, 
and “inferred resources”. Shareholders in the United States are advised that, while such terms are defined in 
and required by Canadian securities law s, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) 
does not recognize them. Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve 
unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economical ly and legally produced or 
extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume 
that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred 
resource s have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally 
or economically. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to 
indicated mineral resources with continue d exploration; however, there is no certainty that these inferred 
mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Under 
Canadian rules inferred mineral resources must not be included in the economic anal ysis, production schedules, 
or estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre -Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and 
cash flow models of developed mines. Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in economic studies as 
provid ed under NI 43 -101 (as defined below). These standards are similar to, but differ in some ways from, the 
requirements of the SEC that are applicable to domestic United States reporting companies and foreign private 
issuers not eligible for the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Any mineral reserves and mineral resources 
reported by the Company  in accordance with NI 43 -101 (as defined below) may not qualify as such under SEC 
standards under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S -K. Therefore, United States investo rs are also cautioned not to 
assume that all or any part of the inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. 
Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally 
only p ermits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. 
Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in these documents 
may not be comparable to information made pub lic by United States companies subject to the reporting and 
disclosure requirements of the SEC.  
 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND NON -GAAP  MEASURES  
 
Discovery has prepared its interim consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, in 
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards . As a result, they may not be comparable to financial statements 
prepared in accordance with other financial reporting frameworks, including generally accept ed accounting 
principles used in the US (“ GAAP ”).  
 
The Company  has included certain non -GAAP performance measures and ratios as detailed below. In the mining 
industry, these are common performance measures and ratios but may not be comparable to similar measures 
or ratios presented by other issuers and the non -GAAP measures and ratios do not have any standardized 
meaning. Accordingly, these measures and ratios are included  to provide additional information and should not 
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in a ccordance with IFRS  
Accounting Standards . Total cash costs per ounce, all -in sustaining costs, and free cash flow, are all forward -
looking non -GAAP financial measures or ratios. As the Cordero Project is not in production, these prospective 
non-GAAP financial measures or ratios may not be reconciled to the nearest comparable measure under IFRS  
Accounting Standards  and there is no equivalent historical non -GAAP financial measure or ratio for these DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
22  prospective non -GAAP financial measures  or ratios . Each non -GAAP financial measure and ratio used herein is 
described in more detail below.  
 
Total Cash Costs  per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  calculated total cash costs per silver equivalent (“AgEq”) payable ounce by dividing the sum of 
operating costs, royalty costs, production taxes, refining and shipping costs, net of by -product silver credits, by 
payable ounces. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company  
believes that this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance.  
 
All-in Sustaining Costs  and All -in Sustaining Costs per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  has provided an all -in sustaining costs performance measure that reflects all the expenditures 
that are required to produce an ounce of silver from operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the 
measure across the industry, the Company ’s definition conforms to the all -in sustaining cost definition as set 
out by the World Gold Council in its updated G uidance Note issued in 2018 . The Company  believes that this 
measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance and th e Company ’s ability to generate 
free cash flow from current operations. Subsequent amendments to the guidance have not materially affected 
the figures presented.  
 
AISC is calculated as: [Operating costs (mining, processing and G&A) + Royalties + Concentrate Transportation 
+ Treatment & Refining Charges + Concentrate Penalties + Sustaining Capital (excluding $37M of capex for the 
initial purchase of mining fleet in Y ear 1)] / Payable AgEq ounces.  
 
Free Cash Flow  
 
Free Cash Flow is a non -GAAP performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash 
flows invested in mineral property, plant, and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets. The Company  
believes that this measure is useful to the external users in assessing the Company ’s ability to generate cash 
flows from its mineral projects.
