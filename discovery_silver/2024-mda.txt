DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
 
The Company was incorporated on October 10, 1986 under the laws of British Columbia as Ayubowan Capital 
Ltd. On June 13, 2017, the Company’s name was changed to Discovery Metals Corp. On April 14, 2021, the 
Company’s name was changed to Discovery Silver Corp.  The Company ’s Common Shares are listed on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”)  under the symbol “DSV”, on the OTCQX under the symbol “DSVSF”, and on the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “1CU0”.  
 
The Company is principally engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties, with 
a focus on advancing assets capable of supporting profitable operations and generating attractive returns for 
all stakeholders. Discovery’s flagship asset  is the 100% -owned Cordero silver project (“Cordero” or the 
“Project”) located in Chihuahua State, Mexico. The Cordero Project has all the attributes of a quality project: 
grade, scale, significant organic growth opportunities, and well located in  mining -friendly Chihuahua state on a 
prolific silver belt. Since acquiring the Cordero Project in August 2019, Discovery’s focus has been on defining 
the economic potential of the Cordero Project primarily through two extensive drill programs and two detailed 
metallurgical testwork programs.  Following the completion of a Feasibility Study titled the “Cordero Silver 
Project: NI 43 -101 Technical Report & Feasibility Study (Chihuahua State, Mexico) ” (the “FS”) with an effective 
date of February 16, 2024 , published on March 28, 2024 , the  focus is now on further de -risking the project 
through the advancement of the construction permitting process, studies on water, power and land , alongside 
property -wide exploration.  The FS demonstrates that Cordero is a tier -one project with the potential to be 
developed into one of the largest silver mines globally.  On January 27, 2025, the Company announced a 
definitive agreement to acquire 100% of Newmont Corporation’s interest in the Porcupine Complex 
(“Porcupine” or the “Complex”) in and near Timmins, Ontario, Canada. Through the addition of Porcupine, the 
Com pany will become a Canadian -based gold producer, with multiple operating mines, in a historic gold 
camp.   The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2025 and the Company will then focus on 
integrating the operations, growing production, enha ncing efficiency, and advancing numerous exploration 
opportunities within the Complex.

3  NON -GAAP  PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
 
Discovery  uses non -GAAP  (generally accept ed accounting principles ) performance measures throughout this 
MD&A as it believes that these generally accepted industry performance measures provide a useful indication 
of the Company’s operational performance. These non -GAAP  performance measures do not have standardized 
meanings defined by IFRS Accounting Standards and may not be comparable to information in othe r Company 
reports and filings. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered 
in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS  Accounting 
Standa rds.  
 
The non -GAAP  performance measures can include – cash cost per silver equivalent payable ounce, working 
capital, all -in sustaining cost per silver equivalent payable ounce (“AISC”), and free cash flow.  
 
For further information, refer to the section entitled “ Financial Information and Non -GAAP  Measures” in this 
MD&A.  
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
 
On January 27, 2025  it was announced that Discovery had entered into a definitive agreement (the "Share 
Purchase Agreement") to indirectly acquire all of Newmont Corporation’s interest in the Porcupine Complex 
(the “Transaction”) for a total consideration of USD $425 million. The consideration payable to Newmont for the 
Transaction consists of USD $200 million in cash and USD $75 million payable through the issuance of 
approximately 119.7 million common shares of Discovery, both of which are payable upon closing of the 
Transacti on, and USD $150 million of deferred consideration to be paid in four annual cash payments of 
USD $37.5 million commencing on December 31, 2027.   
 
To fund the Transaction and provide liquidity in support of operating and growing the Porcupine Complex, 
Discovery has entered into binding commitments for approximately USD $555 million of financing, including 
USD $400 million related to royalty and debt agreements with Franco Nevada Corporation  (“Franco Nevada”) 
and approximately USD $155 million from a bought deal public offering of subscription receipts  (the “Bought 
Deal) . The Bought Deal closed on February 3, 2025  and pursuant to the requirements of the T oronto Stock 
Exchange a special meeting will be held on March 27, 2025 to obtain shareholder approval (the “Special 
Meeting”).  
 
Pursuant to the Bought Deal, the Company issued an aggregate of 275,000,000 Subscription Receipts at an issue 
price of C$0.90 per Subscription Receipt, for gross proceeds of C$247,500,000, which includes 25,000,000 
Subscription Receipts issued pursuant to the exercise, in full, of t he over -allotment option granted to the 
underwriters in connection with the Bought Deal. Pursuant to the requirements of the Toronto Stock Exchange , 
a special meeting of the Company’s shareholders has been scheduled and is set for March 27, 2025. I f the 
issuance of  119.7 million common shares to Newmont  is not approved by shareholders at the Special Meeting , 
Discovery will reduce this number and issue approximately 94.5 million common shares to Newmont, and the 
first deferred cash payment will be increased to approximately USD $53.3 million. As part of the financing 
package with Franco -Nevada, th e Company issued 3,900,000 share purchase warrants, exercisable at $0.95 with 
a 3-year expiry.

4  Prior to the closing of the Transaction, Porcupine will be transferred into a newly formed corporation, Dome 
Mine Ltd. pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. On closing of the Transaction, all of the issued and 
outstanding common shares of Dome Mine Ltd.  will be sold to Discovery pursuant to the Share Purchase 
Agreement. The transaction is also subject to other customary conditions prior to the expected close in the first 
half of 2025.  
 
CORDERO OVERVIEW  
 
Highlights  
 
On April 1, 2024, the Company announced  the filing of its National Instrument 43 -101 (“NI 43 -101”) technical 
report entitled:  Cordero Silver Project, Technical Report & Feasibility Study  dated February 16, 2024 (the 
“Technical Report”), in respect of Discovery’s Cordero deposit in Mexico. The report was filed on March 28, 
2024 and was authored by Ausenco Engineering Canada ULC, with support from AGP Mining Consultants Inc., 
WSP USA Environment and Infrastructure Inc. and RedDot3D Inc.  
 
Highlights include:  
• Large -scale, long -life production:  19-year mine life with  an average of 37 million ounces (“Moz”) of silver 
equivalent (“AgEq”)  production from  Year 1 to Year 12.  
• Low costs, high margins:  average AISC of less than USD $12.50 over the first eight years of mine life placing 
Cordero in the bottom half of the cost curve.  
• Attractive project economics:  Base Case after -tax Net Present Value at 5% (“NPV”) of USD $1.2 billion and 
IRR of 22% with NPV expanding to USD $2.2 billion in Year 4.  
• Low capital intensity:  initial development capital expenditures  (“capex”)  of USD $606 million resulting in an 
attractive after -tax NPV -to-capex ratio of 2.0.  
• Tier 1 reserve base:  Reserves of silver (“Ag”)  - 302 Moz, gold (“Au”)  - 840 thousand ounces (“koz”) , lead 
(“Pb”)  – 3.0 billion pounds (BIb)  and zinc (“Zn”)  – 5.2 Blb, positioning Cordero as one of the largest 
undeveloped silver deposits globally.  
• Clear upside potential:  240 million tonnes (“Mt”)  of Measured & Indicated Resource sit outside the FS pit 
highlighting the potential to materially extend the mine life at modestly higher silver prices.  
• Substantial socio -economic contribution:  an initial investment of USD $606 million, 2,500 jobs created 
during construction, USD $4.0 billion of goods  and services purchased and estimated tax contributions of 
over USD $1.4 billion within Mexico.  
• Environmental standards:  third -party reviews of proposed environmental practices to ensure adherence 
to both Mexican regulatory standards and Equator Principles 4. The Study also incorporates investment in 
infrastructure and technology to recycle wastewater from local communities  with discharged water 
representing the primary source of water for mine operations.

5  Project Economics  
 
The economics for the FS were based on the following metal prices: Ag - $22.00/oz, Au - $1,600/oz, Pb - $1.00/lb 
and Zn - $1.20/lb  A 10% increase in metal prices results in a 40% increase in the Project NPV to over USD$1,647 
million . At metal prices as at March 25, 2025, the NPV would total USD$2, 262 million, a 92% increase over the 
FS Project NPV.  The FS payback  at base case prices  is 5.2 years due to the expansion of the processing plant 
from 26,000 tpd to 51,000 tpd in Year 3 at a capital cost of USD $291 million. This expansion is expected to be 
funded from operating cash flow.

Resource Update  
 
In conjunction with the FS, the Mineral Resource Estimate for Cordero was updated to incorporate an additional 
34,957 m of drilling in 103 holes since the release of the Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”)  (Mineral Resource 
Estimate now includes total drilling of 310,861 m in 793 drill holes). The Measured & Indicated Resource has 
grown by 70 Moz AgEq to 1,203 Moz AgEq with the Inferred Resource being reduced by 13 Moz AgEq to 154 
Moz AgEq as summarized bel ow. The overall expansion of the resource was lar gely driven by exploration success 
at depth and in the northeast part of the deposit.  
• Measured & Indicated Resource of 1,203 Moz AgEq at an average grade of 52 g/t AgEq  (719 Mt grading 
21 g/t Ag, 0.06 g/t Au, 0.30% Pb and 0.57% Zn)  
• Inferred Resource of 154 Moz AgEq at an average grade of 33 g/t AgEq  (148 Mt grading 14 g/t Ag, 0.02 g/t 
Au, 0.18% Pb and 0.35% Zn)  
 
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
Recent Developments  
 
On March 19, 2025, the Company achieved a significant milestone with the acquisition of 66 hectares of land 
near the planned location of the Cordero processing plant. With this acquisition, Discovery now owns 100% of 
the land required to advance Cordero into development.  
 
OUTLOOK  
 
The anticipated closing of the Porcupine Complex acquisition in the first half of 2025 will transform Discovery 
into a diversified precious metals company combining growing gold production in Northern Ontario, Canada, 
with one of the world’s largest silver  development projects in Chihuahua State, Mexico. The closing of the 
Transaction will also result in a significant increase in the Company cash position, with approximately $240 
million (USD$170 million) of cash expected to be added to Discovery’s balance sheet as a result of closing the 
Financing.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
6  Through the issuance of the Consideration Shares to Newmont, as well as the expected issuance of 
approximately 275 million common shares to holders of the Subscription Receipts through the Bought Deal , the 
Company’s total common shares outstanding are expected to increase from 400.5  million at December 31, 2024 
to approximately 802.3  million upon closing of the Transaction. Under terms of the Bought Deal , each  
Subscription Receipt entitle s the holder to receive, without payment of additional consideration and without 
further action, one common share of Discovery upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain release conditions, 
including the satisfaction or waiver of all material conditions related  to the Transaction . 
 
In terms of Cordero, f ollowing release of the FS, the Company executed a work program over the balance of 
2024 aimed at further advancing and de -risking the Project . The program include d engineering and design work, 
additional permitting, the acquisition or lease of additional surface rights where appropriate, and the 
continuation of the Company’s ESG and community outreach programs.  
 
The two principal environmental permits required for the construction, operation and closure of Cordero are: 
the Environmental Impact Assessment (“Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental” or “MIA”); and the Change of 
Land Use (“Cambio de Uso de Suelo” or “CUS”) . Both permits are subject to review and approval by the 
Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”), Mexico’s federal agency for natural 
resources and the environment.  
The Company formally submitted  its MIA  for evaluation  
in August 2023. The MIA passed SEMARNAT’s legal review soon after its submission and was advanced for 
technical review. In March 2024, SEMARNAT issued a notice for a 60 -day extension to the technical review 
period, which extended the review to late June 2024. As of the en d of 2024, the Company had yet to receive a 
ruling on the technical review of the MIA. Based on favourable developments in Mexico since President Claudia 
Sheinbaum assumed office on October 1, 2024, including public comments in support of i ncreased foreign 
investment and acknowledging the importance of mining to the country’s economy, the Company entered 2025 
increasingly optimistic that approval of the MIA will be received during the year.  The CUS submission is 
supported by a Change of Land Use Study known as an Estudio Tecnico Justificativo (“ETJ”). The ETJ was 
completed by the Company working with third -party  consultants during 2024. The Company plans to file the 
formal CUS submission during the first half of 2025.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
7  Full year 202 4 Compared To Full year 202 3 
 
Net Loss and Total Comprehensive Loss 
 
The Company had a total  comprehensive loss of $ 23,590,584  for the full year of 202 4, compared to a total 
comprehensive loss of $ 14,403,320  for the same period in 202 3. The total comprehensive loss for 202 4 includes 
a non -cash currency translation adjustment (“CTA”) loss of $ 2,695,192  resulting from  the translation of 
Discovery’s Mexican subsidiaries  from their  Mexican Peso (“MXP”) denominated  financial statements to the 
Company’s reporting currency of CAD on consolidation (202 3 – CTA gain  of $1,349,195 ). CTA gain s or losses are 
the result of the appreciation or depreciation of foreign currency balances in USD or  MXP compared to the CAD 
during the period , primarily impacting the mineral property balances.  
 
The overall increase  in net loss during 202 4 when compared to 202 3 is primarily the result of $2,581,467 i n 
business development expenses related to the evaluation of  the Porcupine Complex  (2023 - $447,261  related 
to the evaluation of other projects and other expenditures incurred in the normal course of business) , an 
increase of  $3,261,224  in salaries and benefits  as the Company made key hires and promotions to strengthen 
the management team  (2023 - $868,663 ), and $3 ,574 ,007  in foreign exchange loss (2023 - $2,398,649  foreign 
exchange gain) . 
 
Share -based compensation expense  
 
The Company incurred a non -cash share -based compensation expense of $ 4,446,03 8 during 202 4, compared  
to $ 5,673,104  during 202 3. This decrease  is a direct result of  no stock options being granted in 2024 while  
1,600,000 stock options were granted during 2023 . The Company granted 5,600,615  RSUs and 2,375,997  DSUs 
during 2024 compared to 3,491,631  RSUs and 1,475,997  DSUs during 2023.  
 
Exploration and project evaluation expense  
 
The Company incurred exploration and project evaluation costs of $ 507,38 3 during 202 4 compared to 
$3,743,940  during 202 3. The decrease relates primarily to the regional exploration drilling program  and other 
project evaluation  being postponed during 2024 while the Company awaits the MIA permits . During 2023, an 
approximate 6,200 metre exploration drilling program was carried out outside of the resource pit area result ing 
in a spend of $1,166,601 . 
 
General office and other expenses  
 
During 202 4, the Company incurred general office and other expenses of $ 12,977,449  compared to $ 8,653,089  
during 20 23. The increase was primarily due to  an increase in costs associated with  business development  as 
the Company aggressively pursued opportunities. In anticipation of growth, key management  positions  were 
added throughout the year  to provide the necessary expertise  across all functional areas . 
 
Professional fees  
 
During 202 4, the Company incurred professional fees of $ 1,479,821  compared to $1,547,300  during 202 3. This 
slight decrease is due to  legal fees associated with corporate items related to  public offering in 2023 that  were 
not incurred in 2024.

8  Interest income  
 
The Company earned interest income of $ 2,201,088  during 202 4 compared to $3,095,468 during 202 3. The 
decrease relates to a combination of lower interest rates  and a lower  average cash balance during 202 4. Excess 
cash on hand was placed in highly liquid, short -term instruments including high -interest savings and short -term 
guaranteed investment certificates  during the year.  
 
Foreign exchange loss 
 
The company realized a foreign exchange loss of $3,574,007 during 202 4 compared to a gain of $ 2,398,649  
during 202 3. This foreign exchange loss was primarily due to the appreciation of the USD  against the C AD as 
foreign exchange rates moved from 1.3226  at the end of December 2023 to 1.4389  at the end of December  
2024 . The  MXP decreased against the Canadian Dollar  with  foreign exchange rate s changing  from 0.07818 at 
the end of December 2023 to 0.06929 at the end of December  2024 . 
 
IVA receivable  
 
The Company’s Mexican subsidiaries pay value -added tax, Impuesto  al Valor Agregado (“IVA”) on the purchase 
of goods and services. The amount of IVA paid is generally recoverable but subject to review and assessment 
by the Mexican tax authority (“SAT”). The complex application process and detailed review by SAT can impact 
the collectability and timing of refunds.  
 
During the year ended  December 31, 202 4, the Company received net refund s of $1.1 million  while a refund of 
$8.0 million  was received in 2023  after completi on of an  audit related to a cumulative five -year return filed with 
SAT in 2022 .  
 
The Company classifies the IVA receivable balance as current or non -current based on the estimated timing of 
collection from SAT. Any returns deemed collectible within 12 months are recorded as a current receivable 
while any IVA estimated to be collectible  after 12 months is recorded as a non -current receivable. As at 
December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $ 2,819,754  and $ 2,153,568  as current and non -current IVA 
receivables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  
 
Since the receipt of the cumulative refund, SAT has since forcibly closed all outstanding receivable balances 
prior to 2017 which resulted  in a net write off of $1,293,744 in IVA receivables during the year ended December 
31, 2023.  Subsequent to December 31, 2024, the Company received a refund of approximately $0.4  million.

The Company had a total comprehensive loss of $ 7,419,994  during Q 4 2024, compared to a total comprehensive 
loss of $ 4,539,860  for Q 4 2023. The total comprehensive loss for Q 4 2024 includes a non -cash currency 
translation adjustment (“CTA”) loss of $498,241  from the translation of Discovery’s Mexican subsidiaries MXP 
functional currency financial statements to the Company’s reporting currency of CAD on consolidation (Q 4 2023 
– CTA gain of $ 1,125,737 ). CTA gain s or losses are the result of the appreciation or depreciation of foreign 
currency balances in USD or  MXP compared to the CAD during the period , primarily impacting the mineral 
property balances.  
 
The increase  in net loss during Q 4 2024 compared to Q 4 2023 is primarily due to  $2,092,989 in business 
development expenses  incurred  for the evaluation of the  Porcupine  Complex .

10  Exploration and project evaluation expense  
 
The Company did not incur  exploration and project evaluation costs  during Q 4 2024 while  $839,071  was spent  
in Q4 2023. While the Company awaits the receipt of the permit associated with the submission of the MIA, all 
planned regional or property -wide expenditures were postponed . 
 
General office and other expenses  
 
During Q 4 2024, the Company incurred general office and other expenses of $ 6,470,206 compared to 
$3,473,924 during Q 4 2023. The increase during Q4 2024 was a direct result of the Company pursuing  corporate 
development  opportunities . 
 
Professional fees  
 
During Q 4 2024, the Company maintained a similar spend on general legal, accounting, and other consulting 
fees  when compared to Q4 2023 and incurred professional fees of $290,039 compared to $300,971 during Q 4 
2023.  
 
Interest income  
 
The Company earned  interest income of $ 381,900 during Q 4 2024 compared to $ 1,219,104 during Q 4 2023. 
The lower interest  is due to less average cash on hand during the period and therefore a lower balance invested 
in interest -bearing instruments . 
 
Foreign exchange gain  
 
The company  realized  a foreign exchange  gain of $220,150  during Q 4 2024 compared to a gain of $2,163,173 
during Q 4 2023. This foreign exchange gain was primarily due to the appreciation  of the M XP against the 
Canadian Dollar.  
 
IVA receivable  
 
During Q4 2024, the Company received a net refund of $ 0.6 million  while a refund  of $8.0 million  was received 
in Q4 2023 after completi on of an  audit related to a cumulative five -year return filed with SAT in 2022.  
 
The Company classifies the IVA receivable balance as current or non -current based on the estimated timing of 
collection from SAT. Any returns deemed collectible within 12 months are recorded as a current receivable 
while any IVA estimated to be collectible  after 12 months is recorded as a non -current receivable. As at 
December 3 1, 2024, the Company recorded $2, 819,754  and $ 2,153,568  as current and non -current IVA 
receivables in the Statement of Financial Position.  Subsequent to December 31, 2024, the Compan y received a 
refund of approximately $0.0 4 million .

The Company had net cash used in operating activities of $ 20,752,793  for the full year 2024 compared to net 
cash used in operating activities of $1,525,554 for 2023. This increase is primarily related to movement in 
working capital  and higher business development expenses incurred  during 2024  related to the evaluation of 
the Porcupine Complex . 
 
The Company had net cash used in investing activities of $9,824,205  for 202 4, compared to net cash used in

by financing activities of $ 48,853,867  during 2023. The net cash inflow during 2023 was the result of net cash 
received of $48,741,556 from the marketed public offering ; while t he net cash inflow during 202 4 was the result 
of cash received of $ 1,711,56 3 from the issuance of shares on exercise of options , offset by  $682,528  in principal 
repayments on leases . 
 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  AND LIQUIDITY  
 
The Company defines capital as its shareholder’s equity (comprised of issued share capital, contributed surplus 
and deficit). The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to support the Company’s main activities of 
identifying, defining and developin g mineral deposits, thus creating shareholder value, as well as ensuring that 
the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.   
 
The Company manages its capital structure to maximize its financial flexibility  to enable the Company to 
respond to changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its underlying assets a s well as possible 
business opportunities. The Company does not presently utilize any quantitative measures to monitor its 
capital, but rather relies on the expertise of the Company’s management . Management reviews its capital 
management approach on an ongoing basis . As at December 31 , 202 4, the Company does not have any long -
term debt outstanding , and is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements or debt covenants.  
 
At December 31 , 202 4, the Company had working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities  from

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  AND FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS  
 
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable and deposits, and accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities.  
 
Accounts receivable and deposits are classified as receivables and are measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and 
are measured at amortized cost. These financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short -
term nature.  
 
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and 
information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties 
and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in 
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 
Financial instruments are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the degree 
to which the inputs used in the fair value measurement are observable.  
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or 
indirectly; and  
Level 3  Inputs that are not based on observable market data.  
 DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
14  At December 31 , 202 4 the Company had no financial instruments classified as Level 2 or 3.   
 
Financial Risk Factors  
 
The Company is exposed to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and 
price risk. The aim of the Company’s overall risk management strategy is to reduce the potential adverse effect 
that these risks may have on the Company’s financial position and results. The Company’s Board of Directors 
has overall responsibility and oversight o f management’s risk management practices. Risk management is 
carried out by the Board through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the policies being 
recommended for approval by the Board of Directors at least annually or when changes are  required.  
 
a) Liquidity risk  
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
financial liabilities. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. At December 31, 202 4, the Company had a cash and cash 
equivalents balance of $ 29,310,579  (December 31, 202 3 – $58,944,459 ) to settle current liabilities of 
$8,607,312  (December  31, 202 3 – $12,168,225 ). The Company’s financial liabilities have contractual 
maturities of less than 30 days and are subject to normal trade terms.  
 
At December 31, 202 4, the Company has no sources of revenue to fund its operating and development 
expenditures and has historically relied solely on non -brokered private placements to fund its operations. 
The Company’s cash balance at December 31, 202 4 is sufficient to fund work at Cordero  during 2025 as 
well as administrative needs. The Company may require additional financing to accomplish long -term 
strategic objectives. Future funding may be obtained by means of an equity or debt financing. Refer to the 
“Recent Developments ” section of the MD&A.  
 
b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to fulfill an obligation and cause the 
other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short -term investments, 
accounts receivable and prepaids and d eposits are exposed to credit risk. The Company has assessed the 
credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and short -term investments as low as its funds are held in 
several highly rated Canadian financial institutions.  
 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk related to certain financial instruments as identified 
below, approximates the carrying value of these assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of 
financial position.

15  c) Market Risks  
 
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity prices.  
 
i. Interest rate risk  
 
The Company has significant cash balances and no interest -bearing debt. The Company’s current 
policy is to invest excess cash in high -yield savings accounts or other highly liquid interest -
bearing short -term investments. The Company regularly monitors its cash management policy.  
 
ii. Foreign currency risk  
 
The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. At December 31, 202 4, cash balances 
were held primarily in Canadian and US dollars. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value 
of the Company’s financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies will fluctuate due to 
changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in th e exchange rate between foreign currencies 
and the Canadian dollar could have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows. The  Company does not currently use derivative 
instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, however exchange rates are 
continually monitored for any significant changes. A portion of the Company’s exploration 
expenses are paid in USD, and over the past two years the Company converted a portion of its 
CAD cash balances into USD to reduce its currency risk exposure related to the CAD.  
 
The Company is mainly exposed to foreign currency risk on financial instruments (consisting of 
trade payables) denominated in USD and MXP.  At December 31, 202 4 and December 31, 202 3, 
the Company had the following foreign currency denominated trade payables:  
 
 December 31,  December 31,  
  2024  2023 
United States dollar  $ 3,798,895  $ 6,991,862  
Mexican Peso   898,268   806,771  
 $ 4,697,163  $ 7,798,633  
 
It is estimated that a 10% fluctuation in the United States Dollar and Mexican Peso against the 
Canadian Dollar would affect net loss at December 31, 202 4 by approximately $422,5 42 
(December 31, 202 3 - $779,844 ). 
 
iii. Price risk  
 
The Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices and prices of equity 
securities. Equity security price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact on the Company’s 
net income or loss due to movements in individual prices of equity  securities or price movements 
in the stock market generally. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact 
on net income or loss and economic value due to commodity price movement and volatility. The 
Company closely monitors commodity pr ices, particularly as they relate to base and precious DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
16  metals, and movements in the price of individual equity securities, and movements in the stock 
market generally, to assist in determining the appropriate course of action to be taken by the 
Company.  
 
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
 
The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high -risk nature of its business, which is the 
acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties, primarily in Mexico. Additional risks 
not currently known to the Company, or t hat the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair the 
Company’s operations. If any of these risks occur, including the financial risks described above, the Company’s 
business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.  
 
This MD&A also contains forward -looking information that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward -looking statements as a result of 
the risks faced by the Company as descr ibed in the documents incorporated by reference herein. Refer to the 
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Information”.  
 
Risks Relating to the Porcupine  Complex  Acquisition  
 
Closing of the Porcupine Complex Acquisition  
The Porcupine Acquisition Closing is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt 
of required regulatory approvals. There is no certainty, nor can Discovery provide any assurance, that these 
conditions will be satisfied or, if satisfied, when they will be satisfied. A substantial delay in obtaining regulatory 
approvals or the imposition of unfavourable terms or conditions in the approvals could have a material adverse 
effect on Discovery's ability to complete the Porcupin e Acquisition and on Discovery's business, financial 
condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company  intends to consummate the Porcupine Acquisition 
as soon as practicable after obtaining the required regulatory approvals and satisfying the required closing 
conditions.  
 
Franco -Nevada Royalty Package  
Discovery's ability to complete the transactions contemplated under the Implementation Agreement is subject 
to certain customary conditions that Discovery must satisfy. If Discovery is unable to satisfy one or more of 
those conditions and such conditions a re not waived, Discovery will not be able to receive amounts under the 
Franco -Nevada Royalty Package to fund the Porcupine Acquisition. If Discovery cannot obtain the funds under 
the Franco -Nevada Royalty Package, Discovery may not have the cash necessary to fund the cash portion of the 
Purchase Price and close the Porcupine Acquisition, and the G oldcorp Canada Ltd. (“GCL”)  will, in certain 
circumstances, have the right to terminate the Porcupine Acquisition Agreement. In addition, while it is possible 
that alternative sources of financing may not be available, alternative sources, if available, may be on terms that 
are less  favourable than the terms of the Franco -Nevada Royalty Package.  
 
Potential Dispute with First Nations Community Could Have Adverse Consequences Following the Porcupine 
Acquisition Closing  
In November 2024, the Taykwa Tagmou Nation ("TTN") filed a Statement of Claim against His Majesty the King 
in Right of Ontario represented by the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources ("Ministry 
of Mines") and the Ministry of Environme nt, Conservation and Parks (the "Ministry of the Environment"), GCL, 
and Newmont Corporation, claiming the Crown failed to protect TTN's lands and way of life from the impacts 
of mining in the Treaty No. 9 area, particularly, the Ministry of Mines and Mini stry of Environment issued ten DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
17  authorizations (the "Authorizations") enabling GCL to resume open pit mining at the Pamour mine after 15 years 
of closure without consulting TTN or considering the impacts to TTN's Treaty rights (the "TTN Litigation"). 
Further, the Ministry of Mines accept ed the GDC’s Closure Plan Amendment for filing, allowing the Pamour 
mine to reopen without consulting TTN, which TTN alleges breached the Mining Act and section 35 of the 
Constitution Act . In the Statement of Claim, TTN sought certain relief including stay ing activities under the 
Authorizations issued to GDC until the Action in the Statement of Claim is heard, a declaration the Crown 
breached its constitutional duty to meaningful consult and accommodate TTN respecting the Authorizations 
and the Crown violat ed Treaty No. 9 by issuing the Authorizations, quashing certain of the Authorizations, 
requiring the Crown to cooperate with TTN on various matters and seeking certain damages. TTN had previously 
brought an application for Judicial Review in July 2023 requ esting relief respecting three of the mining 
exploration permits issued to the Seller. In January 2025, Newmont Corporation and the Seller filed a Notice of 
Intent to Defend with respect to this Action. His Majesty the King in Right of Ontario also filed a  Notice of Intent 
to Defend in November 2024. The Company  believes this claim is without merit.  
 
The outcome of this claim is uncertain and could result in delays, additional costs, or modifications to the 
Pamour mine, difficulty in obtaining financing and permits and difficulty in community relations. This claim, 
depending upon its pendency and resol ution, may give rise to material adverse effects on the Company 's 
financial condition, operations, and prospects following the Porcupine Acquisition Closing.  
 
Unexpected Liabilities Related to the Porcupine Acquisition  
In connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, there may be liabilities including environmental liabilities 
associated with the Porcupine Complex that the Company  failed to discover or was unable to quantify in the 
due diligence which it conducted in connection with the Porcupine Acquisition and the Company  may not be 
indemnified for some or all of these liabilities. Following the Porcupine Acquisition Closing, the Co mpany  may 
discover that it has acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities. The discovery of any material liabilities, or the 
inability to obtain full indemnification for such liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company 's 
business, financial condition or future prospects. While the Co mpany  has estimated these potential liabilities 
for the purposes of making its decision to enter into the Porcupine Acquisition Agreement, there can be no 
assurance that any resulting liability including environmental liabilities will not exceed the Co mpany 's estimates.  
 
In addition, the Co mpany  may be unable to retain Porcupine's employees following the Porcupine Acquisition. 
The continuing and collaborative efforts of the Porcupine Complex's employees are important to its success and 
its business would be harmed if it were to lose their service s.  
 
The existence of undisclosed liabilities and the Co mpany 's inability to retain the Porcupine Complex's employees 
could have an adverse impact on the Co mpany 's business, financial condition and results of operations.  
 
Nature of Acquisitions  
Acquisitions of mineral properties are based in large part on  engineering, environmental and economic 
assessments made by the acquiror, independent engineers and consultants. These assessments include a series 
of assumptions regarding such factors as operational performance, status of and impact of policy, legislati on 
and regulations and effective tax rates. Many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond Discovery's 
control. All such assessments involve a measure of engineering, environmental and regulatory uncertainty that 
could result in lower revenue o r higher operating or capital expenditures than anticipated.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
18  Information Provided by GCL  
Information related to the Porcupine Complex in this MD&A  is based on information provided by GCL. Although 
the Company  has conducted what it believes to be a prudent and thorough level of investigation with respect 
to the Porcupine Complex in connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, a certain degree of risk remains 
regarding the accuracy and completeness of such information. While the Company  has no reason to believe the 
information obtained from GCL is misleading, untrue or incomplete, the Company  cannot assure the accuracy 
or completeness of such information, nor can the Company  compel GCL to disclose events which may h ave 
occurred or may affect the completeness or accuracy of such information, but which are unknown to the 
Company . 
 
Regulatory Risk  
The Porcupine Acquisition is conditional upon, among other things, (i) TSX approval, (ii) the completion of the 
Reorganization (which will be subject to certain approvals, including the consent of Ontario's Ministry of Mines), 
and (iii) the approval, or ex piry of the waiting period, under the Competition Act  (Canada). A substantial delay 
in obtaining satisfactory approvals or the imposition of unfavourable terms or conditions in the approvals could 
have a material adverse effect on Discovery's ability to complete the Porcupine Acquisition and on Discovery's 
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, or on the Porcupine Complex .  
 
Failure to Realize Porcupine Acquisition Benefits  
There is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition may fail to materialize or 
may not occur within the time periods that Discovery anticipates. The realization of such benefits may be 
affected by a number of factors, man y of which are beyond the control of the Company . 
 
Moreover, a variety of factors, including those risk factors set forth in this AIF, may adversely affect the 
Company 's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition.  
 
Integration of the Porcupine Complex  
Although the Company  expects to realize certain benefits as a result of the Porcupine Acquisition, there is a 
possibility that, following the Porcupine Acquisition, the Company  is unable to successfully integrate the 
Porcupine Complex into its operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition 
or may be unable to do so within the anticipated timeframe.  
 
The Company  expects to implement certain operational improvements and cost -savings initiatives following the 
completion of the Porcupine Acquisition. Any cost -savings that the Company  realizes from such efforts may 
differ materially from the Company 's estimates. In addition, any cost -savings that the Company  realizes may be 
offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in other expenses. The Company 's 
operational improvements and cost -savings plans are subject to numerous risks  and uncertainties that may 
change at any time.  
 
To effectively integrate the Porcupine Complex into its current operations, Discovery must establish appropriate 
operational, administrative, finance, and management systems and controls functions relating to the Porcupine 
Complex. These efforts, together with the ongoing integration following the Porcupine Acquisition, will require 
substantial attention from Discovery's management. This diversion of management attention, as well as any 
other difficulties which Discovery may encounter in completing the Acqu isition and integration process, could 
have an adverse effect on Discovery's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There 
can be no assurance that Discovery will be successful in integrating the Porcupine Complex or that the expected 
benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition will be realized.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

19  Discovery Will Rely on GCL Following Completion of the Porcupine Acquisition for Certain Services  
In connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, Discovery and GCL agreed to enter into the Transition Services 
Agreement upon the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition pursuant to which GCL has agreed to provide, or cause 
its affiliates to provide, certain se rvices to Discovery that are required for the operation of the Porcupine 
Complex in a similar manner as the Porcupine Complex was operated immediately prior to the Porcupine 
Acquisition Closing. As a result, Discovery will be reliant on GCL’s personnel, go od faith, contractual compliance, 
expertise and judgment in providing the services under the Transition Services Agreement, where the 
Company 's ability to manage operational risks may be limited. Accordingly, Discovery may be exposed to 
adverse developments in the business and affairs of GCL, its management and to its financial strength.  
 
There can be no assurance that the services provided by GCL pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement will 
be adequate for the Company  to operate the Porcupine Complex and facilitate the efficient and effective 
transition of business operations as currently contemplated, or at all. If GCL does not perform the services under 
the Transition Services Agreement as currently contemplated, the operations and financial performa nce of the 
Porcupine Complex may be negatively affected, which could have a material  adverse effect on the business, 
financial condition and future performance of the Company . If, after the expiration of the Transition Services 
Agreement, the Company  is unable to perform these services or replace them in a timely manner or on terms 
and conditions as favorable as those under the Transition Services Agreement, the Company  may experience 
operational problems and an increase in its costs.  
 
Failure by the Seller to meet its obligations under the Transition Services Agreement could have a material 
adverse effect on the operation of the Porcupine Complex , which could in turn have a material adverse effect 
on the business, financial condition and future performance of the Company . 
 
Litigation and Public Attitude towards the Porcupine Acquisition  
The Company  may be exposed to increased litigation from shareholders or other third -parties in connection 
with the Porcupine Acquisition. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the Company 's business and 
results of operations or may cause disruptions to the Company 's operations. Even if any such claims are without 
merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert the time and resources of 
management.  
 
Furthermore, public attitudes towards the Porcupine Acquisition could result in negative press coverage and 
other adverse public statements affecting the Company . Adverse press coverage and other adverse statements 
could negatively impact the ability of the Company  to achieve the benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition or take 
advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, 
and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material ad verse  
effect on the Company 's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
 
Porcupine Acquisition and Related Costs  
The Company  expects to incur significant costs associated with completing the Porcupine Acquisition and 
integrating the operations of Discovery and the Porcupine Complex . The substantial majority of such costs will 
be non -recurring expenses resulting from the Porcupine Acquisition and will consist of transaction costs related 
to the Porcupine Acquisition. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration o f the Porcupine 
Complex into Discovery's existing business and such costs, if incurred,  may have a negative effect on the 
Company 's business, operations and financial performance and cash flows.

20  Increased Indebtedness  
In financing the Porcupine Acquisition, Discovery may incur additional debt under the Credit Facility. Such 
borrowing, to the extent incurred, would increase Discovery's consolidated indebtedness. Such additional 
indebtedness will increase Discovery's inte rest expense and debt service obligations and may have a negative 
effect on Discovery's results of operations and/or credit ratings. Such increased indebtedness may also make 
Discovery's results more sensitive to increases in interest rates. Discovery's de gree of leverage could have other 
important consequences for purchasers, including: (i) having a negative effect on Discovery's issuer debt rating; 
(ii) it may limit Discovery's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditur es, debt 
service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; (iii) it may limit Discovery's ability 
to declare dividends on the Common Shares; (iv) Discovery may be vulnerable in a downturn in general 
economic conditions; and (v) Di scovery may be unable to make capital expenditures that are important to its 
growth and strategies.  
 
Risk of Default in the Repayment of Borrowing under the Franco -Nevada Financing Package  
The Company  has secured the Franco -Nevada Financing Package which includes debt financing pursuant to the 
Credit Facility. In the event Discovery draws on the Credit Facility, Discovery may repay all or a portion of such 
borrowings using proceeds from the issuance of  additional securities. If Discovery is unable to raise sufficient 
proceeds from such intended sale of such securities on terms acceptable to Discovery, its ability to repay 
borrowings under the Credit Facility could be adversely affected. In th e event Discovery is unable to refinance 
borrowings it may incur under the Credit Facility in the manner Discovery intends, Discovery may be required 
to utilize other sources of liquidity including cash on hand, cash from operating activities or other borr owings. 
Discovery may also be required to seek extensions to or modifications of the terms of the Credit Facility in order 
to defer the maturity dates of any borrowings incurred thereunder. Depending upon credit market conditions 
at the time when borrowing s, if any, are due for repayment, and Discovery's own financial performance at that 
time, Discovery may be unable to obtain extensions or modifications of the terms of the Credit Facility on terms 
satisfactory to Discovery, or at all, which could result in  Discovery defaulting on its repayment obligations under 
the Credit Facility and being subject to various remedies available to Franco -Nevada thereunder including 
remedies available under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency legislation.  
 
Drawdowns Under the Term Loan Agreement are Subject to a Number of Conditions  
The ability of Discovery to borrower and obtain an advance under the Term Loan Agreement is subject to the 
satisfaction of conditions precedent by Dome Mine Ltd and Discovery which may be outside of control of 
Discovery to satisfy. For the initial advance, such conditions include, but are not limited to, the lender under the 
Term Loan Agreement being satisfied with a mine plan, financial model, including demonstra ting compliance 
with financial covenants, and technical reports for the Porcupine Complex, review and due diligence on 
disclosure schedules to the Term Loan Agreement, provision by Discovery and Dome Mine Ltd  of the required 
security and opinions, includi ng title opinions on the Porcupine Complex, no events having occurred that would 
individually or in the aggregate have had or could reasonably have a material adverse effect, no default or event 
of default occurring, among other conditions. For all advance s, in addition to the conditions for the initial 
advance, certain additional customary conditions precedent must be satisfied. The ability for Dome Mine Ltd to 
receive and access funds under the Term Loan Agreement is contingent on its ability to satisfy t he required 
conditions to advance.  
 
Nature of Mineral Exploration and Mining  
 
At the present time the Company does not hold any interest in a producing mining property. The Company’s 
viability and potential success is based on its ability to develop, exploit and generate revenue from mineral DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
21  deposits. The exploration and development of mineral deposits involve significant financial risk over a significant 
period of time, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. 
While the discovery of a mine ma y result in substantial rewards, few properties which are explored are 
ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to establish reserves by drilling 
and to construct mining and processing facilities at a site. It is impossible  to ensure that the current or proposed 
exploration programs on exploration properties in which the Company has an interest will result in a profitable 
commercial mining operation.  
 
The operations of the Company are subject to all of the hazards and risks normally incident to exploration and 
development of mineral properties, any of which could result in damage to life and property, the environment 
and possible legal liability for any  and all damage. The activities of the Company may be subject to prolonged 
disruptions due to weather conditions depending on the location of the operations in which the Company has 
interests. Hazards, such as unusual or unexpected geological structures, r ock bursts, pressure, cave -ins, flooding 
or other conditions may be encountered in the drilling and removal of material. While the Company may obtain 
insurance against certain risks in such amounts as it considers adequate, the nature of these risks is suc h that 
liabilities could exceed policy limits or could be excluded from coverage. There are also risks against which the 
Company cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure. The potential costs which could be 
associated with any liabilities n ot covered by insurance or in excess of insurance coverage or associated with 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations may cause substantial delays and require significant capital 
outlays, adversely affecting the future earnings and competitive posi tion of the Company and, potentially, its 
financial position.  
 
Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are the 
particular attributes of the deposit, such as size and grade, proximity to infrastructure, financing costs and 
governmental regulations, including r egulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, infrastructure, land use, 
importing and exporting and environmental protection. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately 
predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on 
invested capital.  
 
Permits and Licenses  
 
The operations of the Company require licenses and permits from various governmental authorities. The 
Company believes that it presently holds all necessary licenses and permits required in carrying out the activities 
which it is currently conducting under  applicable laws and regulations and the Company believes it is presently 
complying in all material respects with the terms of such licenses and permits. However, such licenses and 
permits are subject to change in regulations and in various operating circu mstances. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits required to carry out exploration, 
development and mining operations at its projects.  
 
Administrative changes in  government offices  could result in delays in processing applications and issuing any 
licenses and permits. The Company currently has all necessary drill permits however any future applications 
could be adversely impacted by various factors including the impact of COVID -19, its variants or any other 
pandemic on government offices and processing timelines .

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
22  Competition  
 
The mineral exploration and mining business is competitive in all its phases. The Company competes with 
numerous other companies and individuals, including competitors with greater financial, technical and other 
resources than the Company, in the search fo r and the acquisition of attractive mineral properties, the 
acquisition of mining equipment and related supplies and the attraction and retention of qualified personnel. 
The ability of the Company to acquire properties, purchase required equipment, and hir e qualified personnel in 
the future will depend not only on its ability to develop its present properties, but also on its ability to identify, 
arrange, negotiate, select or acquire suitable properties or prospects for mineral exploration, source suitable 
equipment and hire qualified people. There is no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to 
compete successfully with its competitors in acquiring such properties or prospects, sourcing equipment or 
hiring people.  
 
Environmental and Climate Change Regulation  
 
The operations of the Company are subject to environmental regulations promulgated by government agencies 
from time to time. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on spills, releases or 
emissions of various substances produce d in association with certain mining industry operations, such as 
seepage from tailings disposal areas, which would result in environmental pollution. A breach of such legislation 
may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. In addition, certain ty pes of operations require the 
submission and approval of environmental impact assessments.  
 
Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which means stricter standards and enforcement, fines and 
penalties for non -compliance are more stringent. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a 
heightened degree of responsibility for comp anies and their directors, officers and employees. The cost of 
compliance with changes in governmental regulations has the potential to reduce the profitability of future 
operations. Such impacts may have an adverse effect on the capital and operating cost  of the Company’s 
operations or those of its future customers that may materially affect future operations.  
 
Estimates of Mineral Resources May Not Be Realized  
 
The mineral resource estimates that may be published from time to time by the Company with respect to its 
properties are estimates only and no assurance can be given that any particular level of recovery of minerals 
will in fact be realized or that an iden tified resource will ever qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) 
deposit which can be legally and economically exploited. In addition, the grade of mineralization ultimately 
mined may differ from that indicated by drilling results and such differen ces could be material. Production can 
be affected by such factors as permitting regulations and requirements, weather, environmental factors, 
unforeseen technical difficulties, unusual or unexpected geological formations, inaccurate or incorrect 
geological , metallurgical or engineering work, and work interruptions, among other things.  
 
Short -term factors, such as the need for orderly development of deposits or the processing of new or different 
grades, may have an adverse effect on mining operations or the results of operations. There can be no assurance 
that minerals recovered in small -scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in large scale tests under on -site 
conditions or in production scale operations. Material changes in resources, grades, stripping ratios or recovery 
rates may affect the economic viability of projects. The estimate d resources described herein should not be 
interpreted as assurances of mine life or of the profitability of future operations.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
23  Dependence on Key Personnel  
 
The Company is dependent on the services of its senior management and a small number of skilled and 
experienced employees and consultants. The loss of any such individuals could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s operations.  
 
Limited Financial Resources  
 
The existing financial resources of the Company are sufficient to complete the 2025 de-risking items  at Cordero, 
however they are not sufficient to bring Cordero  into commercial production. The Company will need to obtain 
additional financing from external sources in order to fund the development of its properties and/or to engage 
in other strategic business opportunities. There is no assurance that the Company wi ll be able to obtain such 
financing on favourable terms, or at all.  
 
This risk of financial resources is further amplified by the recent COVID -19 pandemic , the ongoing 
Ukraine/Russia conflict , the Israel/Palestine conflict  and other events  which ha ve had significant impact on 
global economies and financial markets. Should depressed market conditions continue in the medium to long -
term, it may be more difficult for the Company to obtain required financing to complete its long -term objectives. 
Failure t o obtain financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration and 
development of the Company’s properties.  
 
Political Environment  
 
The Company’s mineral exploration activities are subject to various laws governing prospecting, development, 
production, taxes, labour standards and occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, land use, water use, 
land claims of local and indigenou s people and other matters. No assurance can be given that new rules and 
regulations will not be enacted  by current or future governments,  or that existing rules and regulations will not 
be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail exploration, prod uction or development. Amendments to 
current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining and milling or more stringent 
implementation thereof could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial position of the 
Compan y. In addition, as governments continue to struggle with deficits and concerns over the effects of 
depressed economies, the mining and metals sector has been targeted to raise revenue. Governments are 
continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their 
countries. The occurrence of election cycles and subsequent changeover of governments and personnel in 
addition to mining regime changes adds uncertainties that cannot be accurately predicted and any future 
adverse changes in government policies or legislation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates that 
affect foreign ownership, mineral exploration, develop ment or mining activities, may affect the Company’s 
viability and profitability.  
 
Changes to tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions 
and the Company ’s business, financial results and financial condition.  
 
The introduction of protectionist or retaliatory international trade tariffs, domestic “buy local” policies, 
sanctions or other barriers to international commerce, including by the United States and Canada, may impact 
the Company ’s ability to import materials needed to construct projects or conduct operations at prices that are 
economically feasible to be competitive, or at all. Any change to tariffs and/or international trade regulations 
may have a material adverse effect on glob al economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
24  and may, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions including cash flows, 
and results of operations.  
 
Liquidity Risk  
 
The Company has in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by the sale of common 
shares, the sale of assets or through the assumption of additional debt. Movements in the price of the common 
shares have been volatile in the past a nd may be volatile in the future. Furthermore, since approximately 35% 
of the Common Shares are held by two shareholder s, the liquidity of the Company’s securities may be negatively 
impacted should the shareholders ’ position s held change.  
 
Community Relations  
 
The Company’s relationships with the communities in which it operates and other stakeholders are critical to 
ensure the future success of its the construction and development of its projects. There is an increasing level of 
public concern relating to the p erceived effect of mining activities on the environment and on communities 
impacted by such activities. Publicity adverse to the Company, its operations or extractive industries generally, 
could have an adverse effect on the Company and may impact relation ships with the communities in which the 
Company operates and other stakeholders. While the Company is committed to operating in a socially 
responsible manner, there can be no assurance that its efforts in this respect will mitigate this potential risk. 
Further, damage to the Company’s reputation can be the result of the perceived or actual occurrence of any 
number of events, and could include any negative publicity, whether true or not. The increased usage of social 
media and other web -based tools used to g enerate, publish and discuss user -generated content and to connect 
with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions 
and views in regards to the Company and its activities, whether true or not. Wh ile the Company strives to uphold 
and maintain a positive image and reputation, the Company does not ultimately have control over how it is 
perceived by others. Reputation loss may lead to increased challenges in developing, maintaining community 
relations  and advancing its projects and decreased investor confidence, all of which may have a material adverse 
impact on the financial performance and growth of the Company.  
 
Information Technology  
 
The Company is reliant on the continuous and uninterrupted operations of its information technology (“IT”) 
systems. User access and security of all IT systems are critical elements to the operations of the Company. The 
Company’s operations depend, in part,  on how well the Company and its suppliers protect networks, 
equipment, IT systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, 
cable cuts, damage to physical plants, natural disasters, terrorism, fire, power loss, h acking, computer viruses, 
vandalism and theft. The Company’s operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and 
replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as well as pre -emptive expenses to mitigate the 
risks of failures. Any I T failure pertaining to availability, access or system security could result in disruption for 
personnel and could adversely affect the reputation, operations or financial performance of the Company.  
 
The Company’s IT systems could be compromised by unauthorized parties attempting to extract business 
sensitive, confidential or personal information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes or by 
inadvertent or intentional actions by the Co mpany’s employees or vendors. A cyber security incident resulting 
in a security breach or failure to identify a security threat, could disrupt business and could result in the loss of DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
25  business sensitive, confidential or personal information or other assets, as well as litigation, regulatory 
enforcement, violation of privacy and security laws and regulations and remediation costs.  
 
Although to date the Company has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber -attacks or other 
information security breaches, there can be no assurance that it will not incur such losses in the future. The 
Company’s risk and exposure to these matt ers cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the 
evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement 
of controls, processes and practices designed to protect systems, computers, softw are, data and networks from 
attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may 
be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to 
investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.  
 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
 
There have been no material changes to the Company’s commitments and contractual obligations during the 
year ended December 31 , 202 4, and to the date of this MD&A.  Refer to “Recent Developments” section of this 
MD&A for details on the acquisition of Porcupine.  
 
MATERIAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
For a full description of the Company’s material  accounting policies, please see note 3 of the consolidated 
financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 202 4. 
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
 
The new standards, or amendments to standards and interpretations that were adopted  by the Company,  
effective January 1, 202 4, are as follows:  
 
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non -Current (Amendment to IAS 1)  
 
The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine 
whether,  in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date 
should be classified as  current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non -current.  
 
The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.  
 
Future Accounting Standards and Interpretations  
 
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange  Rates  (Amendment to IAS 21) 
 
The amendments address the l ack of exchangeability which applies when one currency cannot be exchanged 
into another  as a result, for example, of  government -imposed controls on capital imports and exports, or a 
limitation on the volume of foreign currency transactions that can be undertaken at an official exchange rate. 
The amendments clarify when a currency is considered exchangeable into another currency, and how an entity DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
26  estimates a spot rate for currencies that lack exchangeability. The amendments introduce new disclosures to 
help financial statement users assess the impact of using an estimated exchange rate.  
 
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 5. The adoption of these 
amendments is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements . 
 
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments  (Amendment to I FRS 9 and IFRS 7 ) 
 
The amendments clarify  that financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized and derecognized at 
settlement date except for regular way  purchases or sales of financial assets and financial liabilities meeting 
conditions for a new exception. The new exception permits companies to elect to derecognize certain financial 
liabilities settled via electronic payment systems earlier than the settlement date.  
 
They also provide guidelines to assess contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets, which apply to 
all contingent cash flows, including those arising from environmental, social, and governance ESG  linked 
features. Additionally, these amendments introduce new disclosure requirements and update others.  
 
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 6. The impact of these 
amendments on the Company’s financial statements has not yet been evaluated . 
 
Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”)  
 
IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1  – Presentation of Financial Statements , which sets out presentation and base disclosure 
requirements for financial statements. The changes, which mostly affect the income statement, include the 
requirement to classify income and expenses into three new categories – operating, investing and financing – 
and present subtotals for operating profit or loss and profit or loss before financing and income t axes.  
 
Further, operating expenses are presented directly on the face of the income statement – classified either by 
nature (e.g. employee compensation), by function (e.g. cost of sales) or using a mixed presentation. Expenses 
presented by function require more d etailed disclosures about their nature.  
 
IFRS 18 also provides enhanced guidance for aggregation and disaggregation of information in the financial 
statements, introduces new disclosure requirements for management -defined performance measures 
(“MPMs ”) and eliminates classification options for interest and dividends in the statement of cash flows.  Non-
GAAP measures that meet the definition of MPMs will be subject to the disclosure requirements  
 
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 7. The impact of these 
amendments on the Company’s financial statements has not yet been evaluated . 
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards requires 
management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results could differ from these 
estimates. Estimates and underl ying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and i n any future periods affected.  
 DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
27  Critical accounting judgments and estimates include but are not limited to the Company’s determination of: 
functional currency; the economic recoverability and probability of future economic benefits of exploration; 
evaluation and development costs; impairment charges; recoverability of sales tax receivable; income taxes; 
and share -based payments. The estimates of non -cash share -based payments expense involve considerable 
judgment and are, or could be, affected by significant factors that are out of the Com pany’s control. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.  
 
a) Critical accounting judgments  
 
The significant areas of judgment considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements include, but are not limited to:  
 
i. Functional currency  
 
The functional currency for each of the Company and its subsidiaries is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Company has determined that 
for each of the Canadian entities, the functional currency is CAD and for the Mexican 
subsidiaries the functional currency is MXP. Foreign exchange differences arising from the 
translation from functional to presentation currency are recognized each period in other 
compre hensive income (loss) and may or may not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss 
depending on future events.  
 
ii. Economic recoverability and probability of future economic benefits of exploration, evaluation 
and development costs  
 
The Company makes determinations whether development and related costs incurred which 
have been capitalized are economically recoverable. Management uses several criteria in its 
assessments of economic recoverability and probability of future economic bene fits including 
geological and metallurgical information, economic assessments and existing permits for land 
access and drilling. The estimates contained within these criteria could change over time which 
could affect the economic recoverability of capitali zed costs.  
 
b) Critical accounting estimates  
 
The information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in 
preparing the financial statements is as follows:  
 
i. Impairment charges  
 
The Company assesses its CGUs at each reporting date to determine whether any indication of 
impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable 
amount is made, which is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
 
Management periodically reviews the carrying values of its exploration and evaluation assets 
with internal and external mining professionals. A decision to abandon, reduce or expand a 
specific project is based upon many factors including general and specific assessments of 
resources, forecast future metal prices, forecast future costs of exploring, and the general DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
28  likelihood that the Company will continue exploration. The Company does not set a 
predetermined holding period for properties with unproven reserves. However, properties 
which have not demonstrated suitable mineral concentrations at the conclusion of each phase 
of an exploration program are re -evaluated to determine if future exploration is warranted and 
their carrying values are recoverable.  
 
ii. Sales tax recoverability  
 
The Company incurs significant expenditures for the purchase of goods and services on which 
sales tax is paid (“GST/HST” in Canada and “IVA” in Mexico). The net amount paid is recoverable 
but is subject to review and assessment by the relevant tax authorities (Canada Revenue Agency 
(“CRA”) in Canada and the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (“SAT”) in Mexico). The 
Company files GST/HST returns on a qua rterly basis with the CRA and regularly files the required 
IVA returns and all supporting documentation  with SAT.  
 
Management applies significant judgment in assessing the recoverability of the IVA including: i) 
collections of previous claims made with the tax authority received during and in prior years; ii) 
communications with tax authorities and iii) review of the a ppropriateness of the supporting 
information.  
 
The Company is in regular contact with SAT in respect of its IVA filings and believes the full 
amount of its IVA receivables will ultimately be received; however, the timing of recovery of 
these amounts and the nature and extent of any adjustments to the Company’s IVA receivables 
remains uncertain. Management assesses collectability and classification of the asset between 
current and non -current at each reporting period.  If there is uncertainty surrounding 
collectability of a specific amount, the Company re cords a provision. Once there is an 
expectation of recovery, that specific amount is recognized as a long -term receivable and the 
related provision reversed . 
 
iii. Share -based payments  
 
The fair value of the estimated number of stock options , RSUs and DSUs  that will eventually vest 
is recognized as share -based compensation expense over the vesting period of the stock options 
with the corresponding increase in equity.  
 
Determining the fair value of stock options , RSUs and DSUs requires  the exercise of judgment 
related to the choice of a pricing model, the estimation of stock price volatility, the expected 
forfeiture rate, and the expected term of the underlying instruments. Option pricing models 
require the input of highly subjective as sumptions including the expected price volatility and 
expected life. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value 
estimate, and therefore the existing mo dels do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure 
of the fair value of the Company’s options at the date of grant. Any changes in the estimates or 
inputs utilized to determine fair value could result in a significant impact on the Company’s 
future operating results or on other components of equity.

QUALIFIED PERSON  
 
The technical information in this MD&A was reviewed and approved by Gernot Wober , P. Geo. , Vice President 
Exploration  of the Company, who is recognized as a Qualified Person (“QP”) under the guidelines of NI 43-101.   
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
 
The Canadian Securities Administrators have issued National Instrument 52 -109 - Certification of Disclosure in 
Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (“NI 52 -109”) which requires public companies in Canada to submit annual 
and interim certificates relating to  the design and effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures that 
are in use at the Company. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported on a timely basis to senior 
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to enable this 
information to be reviewed and discussed so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding the timely public 
disclosure of th e information. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure 
controls and procedures and has concluded that they were effective as at December 31, 202 4.  
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
NI 52 -109 also requires public companies in Canada to submit interim and annual certificates relating to the 
design of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and an annual certificate that includes evaluating the 
operating effectiveness of ICFR. The Company’s ICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with IFRS  Accounting Standards . Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining ICFR. The 
Company used the 2013 Commission of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) 
framework as the basis for designing its ICFR. Due to its inherent limitations, ICFR may  not prevent or detect 
misstatements on a timely basis as such systems can only be designed to provide reasonable as opposed to 
absolute assurance. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of ICFR to future periods are subject 
to the risk t hat the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. There have been no significant changes in the 
Company’s internal controls during the three months end ed December 31, 202 4 that have materially affected, 
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. The individuals performing the duties of the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have each evaluated the operating effect iveness of the 
Company’s ICFR as at December 31, 202 4 and have concluded that the ICFR are effective.

32  CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS CONCERNING ESTIMATES OF MEASURED, INDICATED, 
AND INFERRED RESOURCES  
 
Information in this MD&A , including any information incorporated by reference, and disclosure documents of 
Discovery that are filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities concerning mineral properties have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of securities l aws in effect in Canada, which differ from the 
requirements of United States securities laws.  
 
Without limiting the foregoing, these documents use the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources”, 
and “inferred resources”. Shareholders in the United States are advised that, while such terms are defined in 
and required by Canadian securities law s, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) 
does not recognize them. Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve 
unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economical ly and legally produced or 
extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume 
that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred 
resource s have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally 
or economically. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to 
indicated mineral resources with continue d exploration; however, there is no certainty that these inferred 
mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Under 
Canadian rules inferred mineral resources must not be included in the economic anal ysis, production schedules, 
or estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre -Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and 
cash flow models of developed mines. Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in economic studies as 
provid ed under NI 43 -101 (as defined below). These standards are similar to, but differ in some ways from, the 
requirements of the SEC that are applicable to domestic United States reporting companies and foreign private 
issuers not eligible for the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Any mineral reserves and mineral resources 
reported by the Company  in accordance with NI 43 -101 (as defined below) may not qualify as such under SEC 
standards under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S -K. Therefore, United States investo rs are also cautioned not to 
assume that all or any part of the inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. 
Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally 
only p ermits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. 
Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in these documents 
may not be comparable to information made pub lic by United States companies subject to the reporting and 
disclosure requirements of the SEC.  
 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND NON -GAAP MEASURES  
 
Discovery has prepared its consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, in accordance 
with IFRS Accounting Standards . As a result, they may not be comparable to financial statements prepared in 
accordance with other financial reporting frameworks, including generally accept ed accounting principles used 
in the US (“GAAP ”). 
 
The Company  has included certain non -GAAP performance measures and ratios as detailed below. In the mining 
industry, these are common performance measures and ratios but may not be comparable to similar measures 
or ratios presented by other issuers and the non -GAAP measures and ratios do not have any standardized 
meaning. Accordingly, these measures and ratios are included  to provide additional information and should not 
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS  
Accounting Standards . Total cash costs per ounce, all -in sustaining costs, and free cash flow, are all forward -DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31 , 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
33  looking non -GAAP financial measures or ratios. As the Cordero Project is not in production, these prospective 
non-GAAP financial measures or ratios may not be reconciled to the nearest comparable measure under IFRS  
Accounting Standards  and there is no equivalent historical non -GAAP financial measure or ratio for these 
prospective non -GAAP financial measures  or ratios . Each non -GAAP financial measure and ratio used herein is 
described in more detail below.  
 
Total Cash Costs  per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  calculated total cash costs per silver equivalent (“AgEq”) payable ounce by dividing the sum of 
operating costs, royalty costs, production taxes, refining and shipping costs, net of by -product silver credits, by 
payable ounces. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company  
believes that this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance.  
 
All-in Sustaining Costs  and All -in Sustaining Costs per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  has provided an all -in sustaining costs performance measure that reflects all the expenditures 
that are required to produce an ounce of silver from operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the 
measure across the industry, the Company ’s definition conforms to the all -in sustaining cost definition as set 
out by the World Gold Council in its updated G uidance Note issued in 2018 . The Company  believes that this 
measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance and th e Company ’s ability to generate 
free cash flow from current operations. Subsequent amendments to the guidance have not materially affected 
the figures presented.  
 
AISC is calculated as: [Operating costs (mining, processing and G&A) + Royalties + Concentrate Transportation 
+ Treatment & Refining Charges + Concentrate Penalties + Sustaining Capital (excluding $37M of capex for the 
initial purchase of mining fleet in Y ear 1)] / Payable AgEq ounces.  
 
Free Cash Flow  
 
Free Cash Flow is a non -GAAP performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash 
flows invested in mineral property, plant, and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets. The Company  
believes that this measure is useful to the external users in assessing the Company ’s ability to generate cash 
flows from its mineral projects.
