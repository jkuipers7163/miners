DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  
 
The Company ’s Common Shares are listed on the T oronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”)  under the symbol “DSV”, on 
the OTCQX under the symbol “DSVSF”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “1CU0”.  
 
Discovery’s flagship asset is the 100% -owned Cordero silver project (“Cordero” or the “Cordero Project” ) located 
in Chihuahua State, Mexico. The Cordero Project has all the attributes of a quality project: grade, scale, 
significant organic growth opportunities, and well located in mining -friendly Chihuahua state on a prolific silver 
belt. Since acquiring Co rdero in August 2019, Discovery’s focus has been on defining the economic potential of 
the Cordero Project primarily through two extensive drill programs  and two detailed metallurgical testwork 
programs. Following the completion of a Feasibility Study titled the “Cordero Silver Project: NI 43 -101 Technical 
Report & Feasibility Study (Chihuahua State, Mexico) ” (the “FS”) with an effective date of February 16, 2024 , 
published on March 28, 2024 , the  focus during the remainder of 202 4 is now on further de -risking the project 
through the advancement of the construction permitting process, studies on water, power and land , alongside 
property -wide exploration.  The FS demonstrates that Cordero is a tier -one project  with the potential to be 
developed into one of the largest silver mines globally.  
 
NON -GAAP  PERFORMANCE MEASURES  
 
Discovery  uses non -GAAP  (generally accept ed accounting principles ) performance measures throughout this 
MD&A as it believes that these generally accepted industry performance measures provide a useful indication 
of the Company’s operational performance. These non -GAAP  performance measures do not have standardized 
meanings defined by IFRS Accounting Standards and may not be comparable to information in othe r Company

Q1 2024 HIGHLIGHTS  
 
CORDERO  
 
On February 20, 2024, the Company announced results from its Feasibility Study (“FS”) on the Cordero Project.  
 
Highlights include (all figures are in US D unless otherwise noted) : 
 
• Large -scale, long -life production:  19-year mine life with average annual production of 37 Moz AgEq in Year 
1 to Year 12.  
• Low costs, high margins:  average AISC of less than $12.50 over the first eight years of the mine life placing 
Cordero in the bottom half of the cost curve.  
• Low capital intensity:  initial development cap ital expenditures  of $606 million resulting in an attractive 
after -tax NPV -to-capex ratio of 2.0.  
• Attractive project economics:  Base Case after -tax N et Present Value at 5% (“NPV”) of $1.2 billion and IRR 
of 22% with NPV expanding to $2.2 billion in Year 4.  
• Tier 1 reserve base:  Reserves of Ag - 302 Moz, Au - 840 koz, Pb – 3.0 Blb and Zn – 5.2 Blb, positioning 
Cordero as one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits globally.  
• Clear upside potential:  240Mt of Measured & Indicated Resource sit outside the FS pit highlighting the 
potential to materially extend the mine life at modestly higher silver prices.  
• Substantial socio -economic contribution:  an initial investment of over $600 million, 2,500 jobs created 
during construction, $4 billion of goods and services purchased and estimated tax contributions of over $1.4 
billion within Mexico.  
• Environmental standards:  third -party reviews of proposed environmental practices to ensure adherence 
to both Mexican regulatory standards and Equator Principles 4. The Study also incorporates investment in 
infrastructure and technology to recycle wastewater from local communities  with discharged water 
representing the primary source of water for mine operations.  
Project Economics  
 
The economics for the FS were based on the following metal prices: Ag - $22.00/oz, Au - $1,600/oz, Pb - $1.00/lb 
and Zn - $1.20/lb. A 10% increase in metal prices results in a 40% increase in the Project NPV to over $1.6 billion. DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
4  The payback is 5.2 years due to the expansion of the processing plant from 26,000 tpd to 51,000 tpd in Year 3 
at a capital cost of $291 million. This expansion is expected to  be funded from operating cash flow.

Resource Update  
In conjunction with the FS, the Mineral Resource Estimate for Cordero has been updated to incorporate an 
additional 34,957  m of drilling in 103 holes since the release of the PFS (Mineral Resource Estimate now includes 
total drilling of 310, 861 m in 793 drill holes). The Measured & Indicated Resource has grown by 70 Moz AgEq to 
1,202 Moz AgEq with the Inferred Resource being reduced by 12 Moz AgEq to 155 Moz AgEq as summarized 
below. The overall expansion of the resource was largely driven by ex ploration su ccess at depth and in the 
northeast part of the deposit.  
• Measured & Indicated Resource of 1,202 Moz AgEq at an average grade of 52 g/t AgEq  (719 Mt grading 
21 g/t Ag, 0.06 g/t Au, 0.31% Pb and 0.60% Zn)  
• Inferred Resource of 155 Moz AgEq at an average grade of 32 g/t AgEq  (149 Mt grading 14 g/t Ag, 0.03 g/t 
Au, 0.18% Pb and 0.35% Zn)  
Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  
CORPORATE  
2024 Workplan  
 
On January 2 4, 202 4, the Company announced th e workplan for 2024 with the objective of reaching a 
construction decision later this year or early 2025. Refer to details in the “Outlook” section of this MD&A.  
 
OUTLOOK  
 
Following release of the FS, the Company is executing a work program in 2024 aimed at further advancing and 
de-risking the Cordero Project. The program includes extensive engineering and design work, additional 
permitting, the acquisition or lease of additional surface rights where appropriate , further exploration work and 
the continuation of  the Company’s  ESG and community outreach programs as it work s through the permitting 
process.  
 
Further details about the 2024 work program are provided below.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
5  Engineering  
The Company plans to conduct Front -End Engineering Design (“FEED”) work for the Project. This engineering 
work consists of early project planning and will advance engineering definition to a higher degree, offering more 
certainty in estimated capital costs. It will also enable the Company to place orders for long lead -time items and  
to define and tender the EPCM scope in more detail.  
Permitting  
The two principal environmental permits required for the construction, operation and closure of Cordero are: 
the Environmental Impact Assessment (“Manifestacion de Impacto Ambiental” or “MIA”); and the Change of 
Land Use (“Cambio de Uso de Suelo” or “CUS”) . Both permits are subject to review and approval by the 
Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”), Mexico’s federal agency for natural 
resources and the environment.  
The Company formally submitted for evaluation its MIA in August 2023.  
The CUS submission is supported by a Change of Land Use Study known as an Estudio Tecnico Justificativo 
(“ETJ”). Compilation of the ETJ by the Company and third -party consultants will be largely completed during the 
first half of 2024 with formal submissio n of the CUS targeted for the third quarter of 2024.    
Project De -Risking  
 
Power: Work in 2024 for the powerline will consist of finalizing the powerline route, surface rights access 
negotiations, permitting and engineering for both the upgrade to the existing Camargo II substation and the 
new powerline to site. The option to use renewable energy sources at site to supple ment grid power will also 
be evaluated.  
Surface rights : After securing surface rights corresponding with the planned open pit and key infrastructure 
locations at Cordero in 2023, the Company will focus on acquiring ancillary surface rights where appropriate as 
well as securing long -term access and lease agree ments for nearby land as required.  
Water : In 2024, the Company will initiate the permitting process for the zoning of the groundwater rights it 
already owns. The Company also plans to advance engineering work for the planned major upgrade to local 
water treatment infrastructure  and accompanying water pipeline  in addition to drilling and testing more 
pumping well holes and monitoring wells . 
Exploration  
Exploration work in 2024 is expected to include mapping and sampling of new target areas. Key target areas 
include La Perla (10 km south of Cordero), Dos Mil Diez (immediately southwest of Cordero) and Porfido Norte 
(10 km north of Cordero).  
• La Perla  – work will focus on a zone of anomalous silver from rock sampling within a very large alteration 
footprint and high chargeability / low resistivity anomalies defined by the geophysics program 
completed in 2022. Historical mine workings are also p resent within a northeast trending structural 
corridor (parallel to the orientation of the main mineralized trends at Cordero).  
• Dos Mil Diez  – further mapping and sampling is planned to support the evaluation of chargeability 
anomalies identified during an IP survey completed in 2022. Dos Mil Diez is located in an area of mapped 
intrusives, veining and alteration, directly to the s outhwest of Cordero.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
6  • Porfido Norte  – additional mapping and sampling is planned to define targets within a northeast 
trending structural corridor in this area.  
In addition to the technical work planned in 2024 to further progress Cordero, the Company also plans to 
advance all financing options for the Project through the course of the year. These options include equity, debt, 
offtake, joint ventures, partnerships , lease financing on major equipment, streams, royalties and other strategic 
alternatives.  
The Company is well positioned to finance the 2024 work program with a cash position of approximately $50 
million  as at May 14 , 2024, and no debt.

7  Q1 2024 Compared to Q1 2023 
 
Net loss and t otal comprehensive income ( loss) 
 
The Company had  total comprehensive income  of $1,118,080  during Q 1 2024, compared to a total 
comprehensive loss of $ 3,344,648  for Q1 2023. The total comprehensive income  for Q 1 2024 includes a non -
cash currency translation adjustment (“CTA ”) gain of $ 1,798,885  from  the translation of Discovery Silver’s 
Mexican subsidiaries Mexican Peso (“MXP”) functional currency financial statements to the Company’s 
reporting currency of CAD on consolidation (Q 1 2023 – CTA gain  of $655,070 ). The CTA gain  resulted from the 
appreciation of the MXP compared to the CAD during Q 1 2024, primarily  impacting the mineral property 
balances  which have increased significantly from the compara tive Q1 2023  period due to the capitalization of 
exploration and evaluation expenditures . 
 
The decrease in net loss during Q 1 2024 compared to Q 1 2023 mainly  resulted from the Company beginning to 
capitalize eligible exploration and evaluation expenditures that are likely to be recoverable by future exploration 
and development based on the successful completion of a pre -feasibility study in January 2023 which declared 
proven and probable reserves for the Cordero project. Additionally, lower share -based compensation expense 
and higher interest income received also contributed to the decrease in ne t loss in Q1 202 4 compared to Q1 
2023. 
 
Share -based compensation expense  
 
The Company incurred a non -cash share -based compensation expense of $ 881,496  during Q 1 2024, compared 
to $1,028,070  during Q 1 2023. The decrease was due to a higher  number of stock options issued to directors, 
employees, and consultants during Q1 2023 with  higher calculated fair value s than the  RSU’s and DSU’s  granted 
during Q1 2024. There were no options granted during Q1 2024.  
 
Exploration and project evaluation expense  
 
The Company incurred and expensed exploration and project evaluation costs of $ 153,447  during Q 1 2024 
compared to $ 653,881  in Q 1 2023 primarily as a result of a focus on the Cordero Project over regional 
exploration targets . Expenditures  directly related to the Cordero Project are capitalized  to mineral properties .  
 
General office and other expenses  
 
During Q 1 2024, the Company incurred general office and other expenses of $ 1,941,475  compared to 
$1,656,126  during Q 1 2023. The increase quarter over quarter was  primarily  related to  higher salaries and 
benefits costs  as the Company continues to strengthen the management team at both corporate head office 
and in Mexico.  
 
Professional fees  
 
During Q 1 2024, the Company incurred professional fees of $ 504,024  compared to $ 550,902  during Q 1 2023 
relating to legal, accounting, and other consulting fees.  The higher  professional fees in Q1 2023 were  due 
primarily to legal and consulting fees incurred related to the Company’s graduation to the TSX , and legal and 
audit fees incurred for the filing of the base shelf prospectus .

8  Interest income  
The Company  earned  interest income of $ 699,88 1 during Q 1 2024 compared to $ 405,345  during Q 1 2023. The 
increase is due to  a higher cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the marketing offering during Q2 
2023 and a rise in interest rates . These two factors combined  generated  higher interest income on cash 
balances , short term guaranteed investment certificates , and term deposits purchased during the quarter.   
 
Foreign exchange gain  
 
The company  realized  a foreign exchange  gain of $1,976,289  during  Q1 2024 compared to a gain of $288,395  
during Q 1 2023. This foreign exchange gain was due to the appreciation of the US Dollar and Mexican Peso 
against the Canadian Dollar that resulted in the Company’s US Dollar and Mexican Peso cash balances receiving 
a foreign exchange gain on translation into the Company’s Canadian Dollar reporting currency.  
 
IVA receivable  
 
The Company’s Mexican subsidiaries pay value -added tax, Impuesto al Valor Agregado (“IVA”) on the purchase 
of goods and services. The amount of IVA paid is recoverable but subject to review and assessment by the 
Mexican tax authority (“SAT”). The complex a pplication process and detailed review by SAT can impact the 
collectability and timing of refunds.  
 
During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed an in -person audit with SAT and 
received a net refund of $8.0 million, including interest and inflationary adjustments less legal fees. This refund 
was for a cumulative five -year return  filed with SAT in 2022, for months beginning August 2017 through May 
2022 (the “Cumulative Refund”). The favourable assessment provided the Company with greater confidence on 
future IVA collection. All prior provisions recorded against the IVA receivable balance were reversed in 2023.  
 
The Company classifies the IVA receivable balance as current or non -current based on the estimated timing of 
collection from SAT. Any returns deemed collectible within 12 months are recorded as a current receivable 
while any IVA estimated to be collectible  after 12 months is recorded as a non -current receivable.  As at March 
31, 2024, the Company had recorded  $2,769,114 and $3,072,632 as current and non -current IVA receivables  in 
the Statement of Financial Position.  
 
CASH FLOW  
 
The Company had net cash used in operating activities of $ 3,334,740  for Q1 202 4 compared to net cash used in 
operating activities of $ 3,224, 234 for Q1 2023. Based on the successful completion of a pre -feasibility study in 
January 2023  declaring  proven and probable reserves for the Cordero project , the Company beg an capitalizing  
eligible exploration and evaluation expenditures that are likely to be recoverable by future exploration and 
development.  
 
The Company had net cash  used in  investing activities of $ 4,453,550  for Q1 2024 compared to net cash used in 
investing activities of $5,881,008 for Q1 2023, mainly related to the mineral property additions capitalized to 
the Cordero Project  in both periods . 
 
The Company had net cash used in  financing activities of $ 23,921  during Q1 2024 compared to cash provided 
by financing activities of $ 176,047  during  Q1 2023. The net cash outflow  during Q1 2024 was the result of the DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

received of $195,09 5 from the exercise of stock options.  
 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  AND LIQUIDITY  
 
The Company defines capital as its shareholder’s equity (comprised of issued share capital, contributed surplus 
and deficit). The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to support the Company’s main activities of 
identifying, defining , and developing mineral deposits, with the goal of creating shareholder value, as well 
ensuring that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.   
 
The Company manages its capital structure to maximize its financial flexibility to enable the Company to 
respond to changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets and business 
opportunities. Management reviews its capi tal management approach on an ongoing basis and believes that 
this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable. The current excess funds realized from the 
non-brokered private placements are invested in highly liquid, interest -bearing m arketable securities with no 
restrictions on redemption.   
 
At March  31, 202 4, the Company does not have any long -term debt outstanding and is not subject to any 
externally imposed capital requirements or debt covenants. There was no change to the Company’s approach 
to capital management during the  three months  ended March  31, 202 4.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  AND FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS  
 
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable and deposits, and accounts payable 
and accrued liabilities.  
 
Accounts r eceivable  and deposits  are classified as receivables and are measured at amortized cost using the 
effective interest method. Accounts  payable  and accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and 
are measured at amortized cost. These financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short -
term nature.  
 
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and 
information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties 
and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in 
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 
Financial instruments are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the degree 
to which the inputs used in the fair value measurement are observable.  
 
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or 
indirectly; and  
Level 3  Inputs that are not based on observable market data.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
11  At March  31, 202 4 the Company had no financial instruments classified as Level 2 or 3.   
 
Financial Risk Factors  
 
The Company is exposed to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and 
price risk. The aim of the Company’s overall risk management strategy is to reduce the potential adverse effect 
that these risks may have on the Company’s financial position and results. The Company’s Board of Directors 
has overall responsibility and oversight of management’s risk m anagement practices. Risk management is 
carried out by the Board through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the policies being 
recommended for approval by the Board of Directors at least annually or when changes are required.  
 
a) Liquidity risk  
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
financial liabilities. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. At March 31, 202 4, the Company had a cash and cash 
equivalents balance of $ 50,704,880  (December 31, 202 3 – $58,944,459 ) to settle current liabilities of 
$11,443,293  (December  31, 202 3 – $12,168,225 ). The Company’s financial liabilities have contractual 
maturities of less than 30 days and are subject to normal trade terms.  
 
At March 31, 202 4, the Company has no sources of revenue to fund its operating and development 
expenditures and has historically relied solely on non -brokered private placements to fund its operations. 
The Company’s current cash balance is sufficient to fund the 202 4 work program as well as the existing 
administrative needs. The Company may require additional financing to accomplish long -term strategic 
objectives.  
 
b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to fulfill an obligation and cause the 
other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short -term investments, 
accounts receivable and prepaids and d eposits are exposed to credit risk. The Company has assessed the 
credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and short -term investments as low as its funds are held in 
several highly rated Canadian financial institutions.  
 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk related to certain financial instruments as identified 
below, approximates the carrying value of these assets on the Company’s condensed interim consolidated 
statements of financial position.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
12  c) Market Risks  
 
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, and equity prices.   
 
i. Interest rate risk  
 
The Company has significant cash balances and no interest -bearing debt. The Company’s current 
policy is to invest excess cash in high -yield savings accounts or other highly liquid interest -
bearing short -term investments. The Company regularly monitors its cash management policy.  
 
ii. Foreign currency risk  
 
The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. At March 31, 202 4, cash balances 
were held primarily in Canadian and US dollars. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the value 
of the Company’s financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies will fluctuate due to 
changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies 
and the Canadian dollar could have a significant impact on the Company’s fina ncial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows. The Company does not currently use derivative 
instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, however exchange rates are 
continually monitored for any significant changes. A portion of the  Company’s exploration 
expenses are paid in USD, and over the past two years the Company converted a portion of its 
CAD cash balances into USD to reduce its currency risk exposure related to the CAD.  
 
The Company is mainly exposed to foreign currency risk on financial instruments (consisting of 
trade payables) denominated in USD and MXP.   
 
At March 31, 202 4 and December 31, 202 3, the Company had the following foreign currency 
denominated trade payables  and accrued liabilities :  
 
 March 31,  December 31,  
  2024  2023 
United States dollar  $ 7,528,001  $ 6,991,862  
Mexican Peso   847,842   806,771  
 $ 8,375,843  $ 7,798,633  
 
It is estimated that a 10% fluctuation in the United States Dollar and Mexican Peso against the 
Canadian Dollar would affect net loss at March 31, 202 4 by approximately $837,570  (December 
31, 202 3 - $779,844 ). 
 
iii. Price risk  
 
The Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices and prices of equity 
securities. Equity security price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact on the Company’s 
net income or loss due to movements in individual prices of equity  securities or price movements 
in the stock market generally. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact 
on net income or loss and economic value due to commodity price movement and volatility. The DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
13  Company closely monitors commodity prices, particularly as they relate to base and precious 
metals, and movements in the price of individual equity securities, and movements in the stock 
market generally, to assist in determining the appropriate course of action to be taken by the 
Company.  
 
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
 
The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high -risk nature of its business, which is the 
acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties , primarily in Mexico . Additional risks 
not currently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair the 
Company’s operations. If any of these risks occur, including the financial risks described above, the Company’s 
business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.  
 
For a detailed discussion of risks, refer to the Company’s MD&A and Annual Information Form (“AIF”) for the 
year ended December 31, 202 3 available on the Company’s website.  
 
This MD&A also contains forward -looking information that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward -looking statements as a result of 
the risks faced by the Company as descr ibed in the documents incorporated by reference herein. Refer to the 
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Information”.  
 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
 
There have been no material changes to the Company’s commitments and contractual obligations during the 
three months  ended March  31, 202 4, and to the date of this MD&A.  
 
SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
For a full description of the Company’s significant  accounting policies, please see note 3 of the consolidated 
financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 202 3. 
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 
Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
 
The new standards, or amendments to standards and interpretations that were adopted by the Company, 
effective January 1, 202 4, are as follows:  
 
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non -Current (Amendment to IAS 1)  
 
The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine 
whether,  in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date 
should be classified as  current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non -current.

MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
14  The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s interim financial 
statements.  
 
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS  Accounting Standards requires 
man agement to make estimates, judg ments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results could differ from these 
estimates.  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected .  
 
Information about critical judgments and estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most  
significant effect on the amounts recognized in the interim financial statements for the three  months  ended  
March 31 , 2024, are consistent with those applied and disclosed in note 5 of the annual consolidated  financial 
statements  for the year ended December 31, 2023 . The Company's interim results are not necessarily indicative 
of its results for a full  year. 
  
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
 
The Company does not have any off -balance sheet arrangements.  
 
QUALIFIED PERSON  
 
The technical information in this MD&A was reviewed and approved by Gernot Wober , P. Geo. , Vice President 
Exploration  of the Company, who is rec ognized as a Qualified Person (“QP”) under the guidelines of NI 43-101.   
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
 
The Canadian Securities Administrators have issued National Instrument 52 -109 - Certification  of Disclosure in 
Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (“NI 52 -109”) which requires public companies in Canada to submit annual 
and interim certificates relating to the design and effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures that 
are in use at th e Company. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported on a timely basis to senior 
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chie f Financial Officer, to enable this 
information to be reviewed and discussed so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding the timely public 
disclosure of the information. Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure 
control s and procedures and has concluded that they were effective as at March 31, 2024 .  
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
 
NI 52 -109 also requires public companies in Canada to submit interim and annual certificates relating to the 
design of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and an annual certificate that includes evaluating the 
operating effectiveness of ICFR. The Company’s ICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with IFRS  Accounting Standards . Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining ICFR. The DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
15  Company used the 2013 Commission of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) 
framework as the basis for designing its ICFR. Due to its inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect 
misstatements on a timely basis as such systems can only be designed to provide reasonable as opposed to 
absolute assurance. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of ICFR to future periods are subject 
to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions , or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. There have been no significant changes in the 
Company’s internal controls during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or 
are reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. The individuals performing the duties of the Company’s Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have each evaluated the operating  effectiveness of the 
Company’s ICFR as at March 31, 2024  and have concluded that  the ICFR are effective.

“forward -looking information” and “forward -looking statements” within the meaning of applicable securities 
laws. Forward -looking information i s often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “seek”, 
“anticipate”, “plan”, “continue”, “planned”, “expect”, “project”, “predict”, “potential”, “targeting”, “intends”, 
“believe”, and similar expressions, or describes a “goal”, or variatio n of such words and phrases or states that 
certain actions, events or results “may”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be 
achieved. Statements relating to mineral resources are deemed to be forward -looking statements, as they  
involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the mineral resources 
described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated or that it will be commercially viable to produce any 
portion of such resources. Forward -lookin g statements in this MD&A  include, but may not be limited to, 
statements and expectations regarding: outlooks for the Cordero Project pertaining to production rates, mining 
and processing rates, total cash costs, all -in sustaining costs, capital spending, cash flow, operational 
performance, mine life, value of operations and decreases to costs resulting from the intended mill expansion; 
intended infrastructure investments in, method of funding for, and timing of completion of the development 
and constructio n of the Cordero Project, planned continuation of negotiation of formal agreements with land 
owners and Mexican authorities with respect to the Cordero Project, as well as other statements and

18  CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS CONCERNING ESTIMATES OF 
MEASURED, INDICATED, AND INFERRED RESOURCES  
 
Information in this MD&A, including any information incorporated by reference, and disclosure documents of 
Discovery that are filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities concerning mineral properties have been 
prepared in accordance with the requ irements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the 
requirements of United States securities laws.  
 
Without limiting the foregoing, these documents use the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources”, 
and “inferred resources”. Shareholders in the United States are advised that, while such terms are defined in 
and required by Canadian securities law s, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) 
does not recognize them. Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a reserve 
unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economical ly and legally produced or 
extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United States investors are cautioned not to assume 
that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred 
resource s have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally 
or economically. It is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to 
indicated mineral resources with continue d exploration; however, there is no certainty that these inferred 
mineral resources will be converted into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Under 
Canadian rules inferred mineral resources must not be included in the economic anal ysis, production schedules, 
or estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre -Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans and 
cash flow models of developed mines. Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in economic studies as 
provid ed under NI 43 -101 (as defined below). These standards are similar to, but differ in some ways from, the 
requirements of the SEC that are applicable to domestic United States reporting companies and foreign private 
issuers not eligible for the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Any mineral reserves and mineral resources 
reported by the Company  in accordance with NI 43 -101 (as defined below) may not qualify as such under SEC 
standards under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S -K. Therefore, United States investo rs are also cautioned not to 
assume that all or any part of the inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or economically. 
Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally 
only p ermits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. 
Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources contained in these documents 
may not be comparable to information made pub lic by United States companies subject to the reporting and 
disclosure requirements of the SEC.  
 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND NON -GAAP  MEASURES  
 
Discovery has prepared its interim consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, in 
accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards . As a result, they may not be comparable to financial statements 
prepared in accordance with other financial reporting frameworks, including generally accept ed accounting 
principles used in the US (“ GAAP ”).  
 
The Company  has included certain non -GAAP performance measures and ratios as detailed below. In the mining 
industry, these are common performance measures and ratios but may not be comparable to similar measures 
or ratios presented by other issuers and the non -GAAP measures and ratios do not have any standardized 
meaning. Accordingly, these measures and ratios are included  to provide additional information and should not 
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in a ccordance with IFRS  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED March  31, 202 4, and 20 23 
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
19  Accounting Standards . Total cash costs per ounce, all -in sustaining costs, and free cash flow, are all forward -
looking non -GAAP financial measures or ratios. As the Cordero Project is not in production, these prospective 
non-GAAP financial measures or ratios may not be reconciled to the nearest comparable measure under IFRS  
Accounting Standards  and there is no equivalent historical non -GAAP financial measure or ratio for these 
prospective non -GAAP financial measures  or ratios . Each non -GAAP financial measur e and ratio used herein is 
described in more detail below.  
 
Total Cash Costs  per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  calculated total cash costs per silver equivalent (“AgEq”) payable ounce by dividing the sum of 
operating costs, royalty costs, production taxes, refining and shipping costs, net of by -product silver credits, by 
payable ounces. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company  
believes that this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance.  
 
All-in Sustaining Costs  and All -in Sustaining Costs per Silver Equivalent Payable Ounce  
 
The Company  has provided an all -in sustaining costs performance measure that reflects all the expenditures 
that are required to produce an ounce of silver from operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the 
measure across the industry, the Company ’s definition conforms to the all -in sustaining cost definition as set 
out by the World Gold Council in its updated G uidance Note issued in 2018 . The Company  believes that this 
measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance and th e Company ’s ability to generate 
free cash flow from current operations. Subsequent amendments to the guidance have not materially affected 
the figures presented.  
 
AISC is calculated as: [Operating costs (mining, processing and G&A) + Royalties + Concentrate Transportation
