4  BUSINESS  OVERVIEW   
 
The Company was incorporated on October 10, 1986,  under the laws of British Columbia as Ayubowan 
Capital Ltd.  On June 13, 2017, the Company’s name was changed to Discovery Metals Corp. On April 14, 
2021, the Company’s name was changed to Discovery Silver Corp. The Company ’s Common Shares are 
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the symbol “DSV”, on the OTCQX under the symbol 
“DSVSF”, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the symbol “1CU0”.  
 
Discovery is a growing precious metals producer with assets in Canada and Mexico. The Company is 
principally engaged in the exploration , development and operation of mineral properties  that have 
demonstrated potential for profitable operations and for generating attractive returns for all 
stakeholders. Discovery’s first asset is the  100% -owned Cordero silver development -stage project 
(“Cordero” or the “Project ”) located on a prolific mining belt i n Chihuahua State, Mexico. A feasibility 
study (“FS”)  dated February 16, 2024,  clearly demonstrated the potential for Cordero to be developed 
into one of t he largest silver mines globally, with low unit costs that is capable of generating attractive 
economic returns.  Since release of the FS, work at Cordero has focused on continuing to de -risk the 
project, and to advance the permitting process, with Cordero ’s Environmental Impact Statement 
(“Manifesto de Impacto Ambiental” or “MIA”)  currently being reviewed by the Mexican Government’s 
department of natural resources and environment (“ Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales ” 
or “SEMARNAT” ). 
 
On April 1 5, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of the Porcupine Complex. The Acquisition 
establishes Discover y as a new Canadian -based gold producer, with multiple operations, a large base of 
Mineral Resources and substantial potential for growth  in one of the world’s most prolific gold camps. 
With the closing of the Acquisition, the Company commenced reporting  gold production, and related 
costs, from the Porcupine Operations in Q2 2025 .  
 
A key component of Discovery ’s business is its commitment to achieving excellence in all aspects of 
responsible mining . Consi stent with this commitment,  the Company has been honoured with numerous 
awards in Mexico, including: receiving both the Socially Responsible Enterprise distinction from the 
Mexican Center for Philanthropy (“CEMEFI”) and the  international  Great Place to Work Certification for 
the third consecutive year in 2024 ; receiving CEMEFI’s Best Environmental Practices distinction f or the 
first time 2024; and being awarded the two -year Quality Environmental Certification from Mexico’s 
Federal Attorney’s Office for Environmental Protection or “PROFEPA”  in November 2023. The Company 
also supports energy transition, with plans to increase the use of electric vehicles and other equipment at 
Porcupine, and the ongoing evaluation of using solar energy, battery electric, trolley assist and other 
alternative e nergy systems in the development and operation of Cordero.  
 
PORCUPINE ACQUISITION  
 
On April 1 5, 2025, Discovery completed the acquisition of the Porcupine Complex. Under terms of the 
share purchase agreement ( the “Agreement”) between Discovery and Newmont, announced on January 
27, 2025, consideration paid to Newmont at closing included  $200 .0 million of cash (“Cash Consideration”)

Operations , Discovery completed the  $575.0 million  Financing Package , which included  $400 .0 million  
related to royalty and debt agreements with Franco -Nevada Corporation (“Franco -Nevada ”), and 
approximately $ 175.0 million  of gross proceeds from a bought deal public offering of subscription receipts 
(the “ Public Offering”), which closed on February 3, 2025.  
 
Included in the $400 .0 million  from  Franco -Nevada  are $2 00.0 million  related to a 2.25% LOM  net smelter 
return (“NSR”) royalty , and $100 .0 million  from a 2.00% NSR r oyalty -linked note (collectively, the “Franco -
Nevada Royalties”). The 2.00% NSR royalty -linked note will be extinguished upon the earlier of royalty 
payments being made equal to the equivalent of 72,000 ounces of gold, or Discovery making a one -time 
early cash payment to Franco -Nevada, at Discovery’s sole option, equal to a 12% annual internal rate of 
return . Also included in the $400.0 million  of financing from Franco -Nevada was the $100.0 million  Debt 
Facility . Under terms of the Debt Facility , the Company issued to Franco -Nevada 3.9 million  share 
purchase warrants, exercisable at CAD$0.95 with a three -year expiry. The Debt Facility remained undrawn 
as of the date of this MD&A. Additional d etails of the Financing Package are provided in the press release 
entitled, “Discovery Announces Transformational Acquisition of Newmont’s Porcupine Complex,” issued  
on January  27, 2025  and filed on the Company’s profile on SEDAR+.

Subscription Receipts at an issue price of C AD$0.90 per Subscription Receipt, for gross proceeds of 
CAD $247 .5 million (approximately $175.0 million) , which included 25 .0 million  Subscription Receipts 
issued pursuant to the exercise, in full, of the over -allotment option granted to the underwriters of the 
Public Offering . Upon  closing of the Porcupine Acquisition , the 275.0 million common shares of Discovery 
were issued in exchange for the Sub scription Receipts on a one -for-one basis.  The Subscription Receipts 
were delisted at the close of business on April 16, 2025.

Q2 2025   
Gold production  for the 76-day period , from April 16, 2025,  to June 30, 2025 , totaled 50,552 ounces, which 
resulted from processing 508,791 tonnes at an average grade of 3.39 g/t with average recoveries of 91.3%.  
The 50,552 ounces of gold production was comprised of 16,112 ounces from Hoyle Pond, 27,286 ounce s 
from Borden, for a total of 43,398 ounces from operating mines, and an additional 7,154 ounces from 
Pamour. Gold sales totaled 42,550 ounces, including 14,804 ounces from Hoyle Pond, 21,792 ounces from 
Borden, for total gold sold from operating mines of 3 6,596 ounces, with an additional 5,954 ounces from 
Pamour. The difference between gold sold and gold produced during Q2 2025 mainly reflected timing 
differenc es between gold production and the recognition of gold sales.  
 
Production costs totaled $ 54.9 million. Operating cash costs1 for the operating mines averaged $ 1,334 per 
ounce sold , which reflected production costs , royalty payments, an adjustment for transition services 
agreement (“TSA”) costs related to the Porcupine Acquisition  divided by  gold ounces sold and gold ounces DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

7  produced, respectively.   AISC1 averaged $ 2,123  per ounce sold , comprised of operating cash costs per 
ounce sold, $ 16.1 million ($ 441 per ounce sold) of sustaining capital expenditures, as well as the impact 
of corporate G&A expense, share -based compensation costs  and accretion and amortization costs related 
to site closure obligations.  
 
Revenue  in Q2 2025 totaled $ 142.0  million, representing Discovery’s first quarter of revenue recognition. 
The $ 142. 0 million of revenue resulted from  total gold sales of 42,550  ounces and an average realized 
gold price1 of $3,337  per ounce sold.   
 
EBITDA1,2 in Q2 2025 totaled  $55.2 million compared to a loss before interest, taxes and depreciation and 
amortization of $5.1 million and $6.3 million in Q2 2024 and Q1 2025, respectively. The $55.2 million of 
EBITDA represented earnings prior to the impact of $16. 4 million of depreciation and amortization 
expense , $14.3  million of net finance costs  and $19.0 million of income tax expense in Q2 2025 . The 
significant improvement in EBITDA performance resulted from revenue and earnings generated from gold 
sales following completion of the Porcupine Acquisition on April 15, 2025.  
 
Net earnings for Q2 2025 to taled $5.5  million,  which compared to a net loss of $ 5.1 million in Q2 2024 
and a net loss of $6.5 million  in Q1 2025. The favourable impact of revenue from gold sales, and earnings 
from mining operations  of $68.8 million , more than offset higher G&A  expenses, share -based 
compensation costs and the impact of foreign exchanges losses in accounting for the significant 
improvement in earnings performance compared to both prior periods  when the Company had no 
producing assets . 
 
Earnings per basic share outstanding totaled  $0.01 in Q2 2025 compared to loss per basic share 
outstanding of $0.01 in Q2 2024 and $0.02 per share the previous quarter. Average basic shares 
outstanding in Q2 2025 were 735.6 million versus 397.6 million in Q2 2024 and 401.1 million in Q1 2025, 
with the increase reflecting the issuance of 401.8 million shares during Q2 2025, mainly the 275.0 million 
shares issued through the  Public Offering and the 119.7 million shares issued to Newmont as Equity 
Consideratio n for the Porcupine Acquisition.   
 
Adjusted  net earnings1 and adjusted  net earnings  per basic share1 in Q2 2025  totaled  $28.4 million, or  
$0.04 per basic share, which compared to adjusted net loss of  $2.1 million, or $0.01 per basic  share, in Q2 
2024 and adjusted net loss of $3.0 million, o r $0.01  per basic share, in the previous quarter. The difference 
between net earnings and adjusted  net earnings in Q2 2025 related to the exclusion from adjusted net 
earnings of  the after -tax impact of $16.6 million of business development costs, mainly for legal, 
consulting and advisory services, and other expenses related to the Porcupine Acquisition,  $6.8  million of 
foreign exchange losses  and $2.4 million of one-time TSA costs.  
 
Net cash provided by operating activities in Q2 2025 totaled  $67.1 m illion , mainly reflecting the favourable 
impact of revenue from gold production on both earnings and cash flows. Free cash flow1 in Q2 2025 
totaled $ 27.3 million as net cash generated from operations activities exceeded total capital expenditures 
during the quarter.  
 
Total capital expenditures1 in Q2 2025 totaled $44.2  million, comprised of $ 16.1  million of sustaining 
capital expenditures1 and $ 28.1 million of growth  capital  expenditures1. Sustaining capital expenditures 
were largely focused on  capital development at Hoyle Pond and Borden and construction work to raise DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

expenditures1 mainly related to  pre-stripping at Pamour  and longer -term investment s at the TMA.  
 
Cash at June 30, 20 25, totaled $ 252.5 million  compared to $20.4 million  at December  31, 202 4. The 
Company’s cash position at June 30, 2025 reflected net proceeds received from  the Financing Package , as 
well as the $ 67.1  million of net cash from operating activities, partially offset by the Cash Consideration 
paid for the Porcupine  Acqu isition  at closing,  capital expenditures during Q2 2025,  as well as the impact 
of $51.6  million of restricted cash related to  letter s of credit and cash collateral for government required 
financial assurances  involving  closure plans at the Porcupine Complex.  The Company also had $100.0 
million of additional liquidity at June 30, 2025, related to the undrawn Debt Facility.  
 
YTD 2025  
Discovery did not generate revenue  or earnings from mine operations in Q1 2025 or YTD 2024.  
 
EBITDA1,2 for YTD 2025 totaled  $48.9 million versus a loss before interest, taxes and depreciation and 
amortization of $ 5.6 million in YTD 2024. Earnings generated following the closing of the Porcupine 
Acquisition in Q2 2025 mainly accounted for the significant improvement in EBITDA year -over -year 
performance in YTD 2025.  
 
Net loss for YTD 2025  totaled  $0.9 m illion , or $0.00 per basic share , with  net earnings in Q2 2025 being 
offset by a net loss  of $6.5 million, or $0.02 per basic share,  in Q1 2025,  with the previous quarter’s net 
loss mainly due to the impact of G&A expense and share -based compensation costs during the first three 
months of the year. YTD 2025 net earnings compared to a net loss of $5.6 million, or $0.01 per basic share , 
in YTD 2024,  with G&A , share -based compensation costs and foreign exchange losses mainly accounting 
for the loss in the first half of 2024. Average basic shares outstanding in YTD 2025  were 569.3 million 
shares versus 396.8 million shares for the same period a year ear lier.  
 
Adjusted  net earnings1 and adjusted  net earnings per share1 were $25.4 million and  $0.04 per basic share,  
respectively,  which compared to adjusted  net loss and adjusted  net loss per basic share of $4.1 million 
and $0.01 per share , respectively, in YTD 2024. The  difference between net earnings and adjusted net 
earnings in YTD 2025 mainly reflect ed the exclusion from adjusted net earnings of the after -tax impact of 
$20.2 million of business development expenses  related to the Porcupine Acquisition,  $6.7 million of  
foreign exchange losses , as well as  $2.4 related to one -time TSA costs.  
 
Net cash provided by operating activities in YTD 2025 totaled  $61.0 million, while f ree cash flow1 totaled 
$17.5  million.

2004.  The mill consists of three -stage crushing , two parallel rod mill and ball mill circuits , a single leach 
and Carbon -in-Pulp circuit, followed by a carbon strip and electrowinning circuit. The Mill’s nameplate  
operating capacity is approximately 12,000 tonnes per day  (approximately 4.3 million tonnes per annum) . 
In recent years, the mill has operated at rates well below capacity levels, largely reflecting increased 
maintenance requirements which contributed to reduced availability and utilization rates , as well as 
production shortfalls from mining operations.  Through investment programs launche d following the 
closing of the Porcupine Acquisition, the Company is targeting a return to full capacity operations by 2028 
or sooner.

CORDERO OVERVIEW  
 
The Cordero Project was acquired by Discovery in 2019.  Since that time, the Company has invested over 
$100.0 million in Mexico, conducting significant exploration drilling and technical analysis, leading to the 
release of multiple studies, most recently the FS dated February 16 , 2024 and filed on SEDAR+ 
(www.sedarplus.ca ) on March 28, 2024. The results of the FS confirmed Cordero to be one of the world’s 
largest undeveloped silver deposits, with the potential for large -scale production at low unit costs and 
that is capable of generating substantial free cash flow and attr active economic returns.  
 
Key highlights of the FS include:  
• Average annual production of 37 .0 million silver equivalent ounces (“AgEq”) over the first 1 2 years 
with a total project life of 19 years;  
• All-in sustaining costs1 averaging below $12.50 per AgEq ounce in Years 1 – 8; 
• Base -case after -tax net present value (“NPV”) of $1.2 billion (Base -case metal prices: Silver – 
$22.00 per ounce; Gold  – $1,600 per ounce; Zinc – $1.20 per ounce; Lead – $1.00 per ounce);   Three months ended

OUTLOOK  
 
With the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition on April 15, 2025, Discovery was transformed into a 
diversified North American -focused precious metals producer combining growing gold production in 
Northern Ontario, Canada, with one of the world’s largest silver development projects in Chihuahua State, 
Mexico. In Q2 2025, the Company commenced reporting  gold production from the Hoyle Pond and Borden 
underground mines, as well as from the ramp up of gold production at the Pamour open -pit project.  
 
Key priorities for the Porcupine Operations over the balance of 2025 include:  
• Implementing investment plans aimed at growing mining rates , increasing production levels and 
lowering unit costs at Hoyle Pond  and Borden ; 
• Ensuring the successful ramp up of production at Pamou r; 
• Advancing  studies on the TVZ zone , Dome Mine project  and Dome Mill expansion ; and,  
• Advancing numerous exploration opportunities at each of  site, as well as at  regional targets . 
 
The Company is targeting a total of 1 40,000 metres of drilling in 2025. The goals for the drilling program 
include resource conversion at Hoyle Pond, Borden and Pamour, in support of establishing an initial 
reserve statement for the three mines during 2026. In addition, drilling will also targ et resource 
conversion at the Dome Mine as part of a study to update the Inferred Mineral Resource included in the 
technical report filed on SEDAR+ on January 28, 2025 , entitled, “Porcupine Complex, Ontario, Canada, 
Technical Report on Preliminary Economic Assessment.” The Company is also planning a drill program at  
the TVZ Zone  with a goal of releasing an initial mineral resource in the first half of 2026.

(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
14  As of the date of this MD&A, the Company is well capitalized to fund growth and optimization plans for 
Porcupine and current expenditure plans at Cordero with total cash  of approximately $279.0 millio n. 
 
In Mexico, f ollowing release of the  Cordero  FS, the Company  has conducted a limited work program aimed 
at further advancing and de -risking the Project , with key areas of focus being power, water availability 
and management, permitting, and continuation of ESG and community outreach programs.  
 
Following  the completion of the land acquisition program in March 2025, the next major milestone for 
the Cordero will be approval of the Company’s Environmental Impact Assessment  or MIA  by SEMARNAT, 
which was submitted in August 2023. The MIA passed SEMARNAT’s legal review soon after its submission 
and was advanced for technical review. As of the date of this MD&A, the Company had completed the 
technical review process and was awaiting approval of the MIA.  The Company remains confident that 
Cordero will receive MIA approval.

15  EARNINGS  
 
Revenue  
Discovery reported revenue for the first time in Q2 2025. Revenue for the quarter totaled 142.0  million, 
which resulted from 42,550 ounces of gold sold at an average realized price1 of $3,337 per ounce  sold. 
The 42,550 ounces of gold sales in Q2 2025 w ere comprised of 21,792  ounces sold from production at 
Borden, 1 4,804 ounces sold from Hoyle Pond and 5,954  ounces sold from Pamour.    
 
Earnings from Mining Operations  
Earnings from mine operations in Q2 2025 totaled  $68.8 million , reflecting revenue from gold sales 
reduced by production costs of $ 54.9 million, depreciation and depletion expense of $ 16.4 million and 
royalty expense  totaling $1.9  million.  
 
Depreciation and depletion expense resulted from the addition of $ 876.8  million of mineral properties, 
plant and equipment to non -current assets, including $ 562.9  million of depletable mining interests and 
$313.9 million of plant and equipment assets. Depreciation is mainly recorded on a straight -line basis over 
the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the  LOM , with useful lives of assets ranging from three to 20 
years. In the case of Dome Mill and related infrastructure, depreciation expense is calcu lated using a 
combination of LOM and unit -of-production basis.  
 
Royalty expense of $1.9  million related to  a number of  royal ties existing on the Porcupine Operations , 
mainly Borden and Hoyle Pond,  at the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition. Payments made on the Fr anco-
Nevada Royal ties are not included in royalty expense . Rather, the se payments  are a reduction to the 
deferred revenue liability on the Company’s balance shee t.   
 
Earnings from Operations  
Earnings from operations  in Q2 2025  totaled  $43.1 million , which compared to  losses from operations of 
$2.6 million in Q2 2024 and $6.7 million  in Q1 2025. Improved performance compared to both prior 
periods reflect ed earnings from mine operations in Q2 2025 , which more than offset a significant increase  
in G&A  expense , to $22.9  million , in Q2 2025 compared to $1.8 million in Q2 2024 and $5. 5 million the 
previous quarter. Of the $ 22.9  million, $16.6 million were  transaction -specific  costs for  legal, consulting  
and advisory  services,  and other expenses , primarily related to the evaluation and completion of the 
Porcupine Acquisition . Share -based compensation costs increased in Q2 2025 to $2.0 million from $0.7 
million in Q2 2024 and $1.2 million the previous quarter mainly reflecting the impact of a higher share 
price on costs associated with the exercise of stock options and Restricted Share Units.  
 
For YTD 2025, earnings from operations totaled $36.5 million versus a loss from operations of $5.2 million 
for the same period in 2024. Earnings from operations in YTD 2025 resulted from the  $68.8 million of 
earnings from mining operations in Q2 2025, partially offset by $2 8.4 million of G&A expense , largely 
related to the one-time acquisition -specific costs,  and $3. 1 million of share -based compensation costs.  
 
Other  
The Company had other loss of $6.9 million in Q2 2025 versus other loss of $3.0 million in Q2 2024 and 
other income of $0.2 million the previous quarter. Other loss in Q2 202 5 reflected foreign  exchange  losses DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED June 30, 2025, and 2024  
(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
16  due largely to the impact of a strengthening Canadian dollar versus the US dollar during the quarter. Net 
finance costs in Q2 2025 totaled $11.7 million, which compared to net finance income of $0.5 million in 
Q2 2024 and nil in Q1 2025. The net finance cost s in Q2 2025 mainly resulted from accretion expense of 
$7.8 million  from reclamation and deferred consideration  and interest expense of $6.5 million , primarily 
from the F ranco -Nevada Royal ties, which more than offset the favourable impact of $2.6 million of 
interest income during the quarter , refle cting the significant increase in cash during Q2 2025.    
 
For YTD 2025, other loss totaled $6.7 million compared to $1.5 million in YTD 2024. Other loss for both 
period s related to foreign exchanges losses. Net finance costs in YTD 2025 totaled $11.7 m illion, mainly 
reflecting accretion and interest expense, which more than offset $2.7 million  of interest income .  
 
Net Earnings  
Net earnings in Q2 2025 totaled  $5.5 million , or $0.01 per basic share, compared to  a net loss of $5.1 
million , or $0.01 per basic share , in Q2 2024  and net loss of $6.5 million , or $0.02 per basic share , in Q1 
2025 . Revenue from gold sales and earnings from mining operations following the closing of the Porcupine 
Acquisition w ere the main driver s for improved earnings performance , partially offset by increased G&A 
expense, share -based compensation cost s and exploration expen ditures, as well as the impact of foreign 
exchanges losses and net finance costs.  
 
For YTD 2025, net loss totaled $0.9 million, or  $0.00 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million, 
or $0.01 per  basic  share, for the same period in 2024. Net earnings generated in Q2 2025 accounted for 
the significant improvement in earnings performance in YTD 2025 compared to YTD 2024.

(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
17  Discovery ’s cash balance at June 30, 2025,  totaled $25 2.5 million  compared to  $27.1 million at June 30, 
2024, and $10.5 million at March 31, 2025 . The Company also had additional liquidity at June 30, 2025,  of 
$100.0 million through the undrawn Franco -Nevada Debt Facility. The significant  increase  in cash  was 
largely  related to  the Financing Package, which resulted in the receipt of $468.7 million of net proceeds. 
Also contributing to the increase was net cash from operat ing activities of $67.1  million, which compared 
to net cash used by operati ng activitie s of $8.5 million in Q 2 2024 and $ 6.1 million  in Q1 2025. The $67.1  
million of net cash from operating activities resulted mainly from cash generated from gold sales at the 
Porcupine Operations from April 16, 2025,  to the end of Q2 2025.   
 
Net cash used by investing activities in Q2 2025 totaled $ 291.9 million  versus  $2.1 million in Q2 2024 and 
$3.8 million in Q1 2025 . Cash Consideration paid to Newmont upon completion of the Porcupine 
Acquisition comprised the largest component of net cash used by investing activities  in Q2 2025 , totaling 
$200.6 million . In addition, $51.6 million of cash was restricted during the quart er related to letters of 
credit and cash collateral for government required financial assurances in relation to closure plans 
involving the Porcupine assets . The remaining $ 39.8  million of cash used by investing activities in Q2 2025 
resulted from additions to mineral interests, plant and equipment, mainly representing capital 
expenditures  for investment programs aimed at growing and optimizing the Porcupine Operations.   
 
Net cash provided by financing activities in Q2 2025 totaled $ 470.5  million  compared to $0.6 million in Q2 
2024 and $0. 1 million the pre vious quarter. The $470.5 million resulted  primarily  from the receipt of 
$300 .0 million related to the Franco -Nevada Royalties and $168.7 million representing cash received from 
the February 3, 2025  Public Offering, net of share issue costs.

FINANCIAL POSITION  
  
In addition to the significant increase in cas h during Q2 2025, to $252. 5 million at June 30, 2025, other 
assets also increased during the quarter, mainly due to the Porcupine Acquisition.  Discovery accounted 
for the Acquisition as a business combination under IFRS 3 using the acquisition method which requires 
all identifiable assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded at their fair values as at the date of acquisition. 
The values include d in the Discovery ’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months 
ended June 30, 2025, represent  the preliminary estimates of the fair values of identified assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed from Newmont. Final valuations of assets and liabilities are not yet complete due 
to the timing of the Acquisition and the inherent complexity associated with the valuations . The Company 
expects to finalize the determination of the fair values  of the assets and liabilities acquired and deferred 
taxes within 12 months of the acquisition date . 
 
As at the date of the Acquisition (April 15, 2025), the fair value for the Porcupine Acquisition was 
estimated at $523.8 million. The fair value included the $200.0 million of Cash Consideration, $232.7 
million of value for the 119.7 million common shares of Equity Consideration, reflect ing the significant 
increase in Discovery’s share price since the Acquisition Agreement was announce d, to CAD$2.71 ($1.94) 
per share at April 15, 2025  from CAD$0.9 0 ($0.6 4) per share on January 24, 2025  (the closing share price 
immediately prior to the announcement of the Porcupine Acquisition) , and $92.9 million representing the 
estimated present value of the $150 million of Deferred Consideration . There were also minor value 
adjustments related to the  replacement of RSUs, transfer taxes and working capital movements.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED June 30, 2025, and 2024  
(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
18  Consistent with the acquisition method of accounting for a business combination under IFRS 3 , the fair 
value of  net assets (assets less liabilities) added as a result of the  Porcupine Acquisition totaled $523.8 
million.  More information regarding the accounting methodologies related to the Porcupine Acquisition 
is available the accompanying interim financial statements.  
 
CURRENT ASSETS  
 
Accounts Receivable  
Accounts receivable totaled $ 30.7  million at June 30, 2025 , of which $27.2 million was included in current 
assets. Accounts receivable at June 30, 2025 , compared to  accounts receivables totaling  $3.7 million at 
December 31, 2024, with $2.2 million  in current asset s. The increase in both current and non -current 
accounts receivable primarily reflected receivables related to gold production and sales at the Porcupine 
Operations following the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition on April 15, 2025. In addition, the IVA  
(“Impuesto al Valor Agregad o” or “Value -Added Tax”)  and HST  receivable balance s increased to $6.3 
million, $2.6 million higher than at December 31, 2024. The IV A receivable balance  represents amounts 
expected to be collectible from the Mexican tax authorities through the IVA tax system  and HST receivable 
increased as a result of the Porcupine acquisition . Of the $6.3 million of accounts receivable related to the 
IVA and HST  receivable balance s, $2. 9 million was in current assets, with the remaining $3. 4 million 
included in non -current assets, reflecting the expected timing for the receipt of payment related  to these 
receivables.  
 
Inventories  
Total inventories totaled $1 31.4  million at June 30, 2025 . Inventories included in current assets totaled 
$113.0 million, which included $79.4 million related to the value of ore stockpiles at Porcupine at June 30, 
2025 , $14.0 million related to gold in circuit  inventories and $8.6 million related to precious metals  
inventories. The $ 22.6 million  of in-circuit and precious metals  inventories largely resulted from difference 
between gold recovered (50,552 ounces), gold poured (46,608 ounces) and gold sold (4 2,552 ounces)  
during Q2 202 5. The $18.5 million of inventories included in non -current assets related entirely to ore 
stockpiles that are not expected to be processed within the next 12 months.  
 
NON -CURRENT ASSETS  
 
Non -current assets at June 30, 2025,  totaled $ 1,165.5  million compared to $62.5 million at December 31, 
2024. The increase mainly reflected the purchase price allocation related to the Porcupine Acquisition . 
 
Mining Interests, Plant and Equipment   
Mining interests, plant and equipment increased  to $1,084.2  million from $61.0 million at December 31, 
2024. The increase mainly resulted  from  the addition of $ 562.9  million of depletable mining interests and 
$313.9 million of plant and equipment related to the Porcupine Operatio ns.  
 
Restricted Cash  
At June 30, 2025, non -current assets included $51. 6 million of restricted cash, which represented letters 
of credit and cash collateral for government required financial assurances in relation to closure plans 
involving the Porcupine assets  filed with the Government of Ontario . Upon closing of the Porcupine DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

Porcupine Complex . 
 
CURRENT LIABILITIES  
 
Current liabilities totaled $1 67.1  million at June 30, 2025,  compared to $6.0 million at  December 31, 2024, 
with the increase mainly resulting from higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities and  new current 
liabilities including the current portion s of liabilities related to reclamation liabilities  current taxes payable, 
deferred revenue  and employee -based benefits  
 
Account Payable and Accrued Liabilities  
Accounts payable  and accrued liabilities  totaled $46.3 million  and $ 30.5  million, respectively,  at June 30, 
2025 , ($1.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024) , with the  significant increases 
from December 31, 2024 , main ly reflecting the timing of payments related to the procurement of goods 
and services in support of the Porcupine Operations.   
 
Reclamation Liabilities    
The Company added  $350.7 million of reclamation liabilities related to the Porcupine Operations at closing 
of the Porcupine Acquisition on April 15, 2025. The total reclamation liabilities increased to  $471.9 million 
at June 30, 2025 , due to a change in the discount rate following completion of the Acquisition and as 
accretion expense exceeded net payments made over the remainder of the quarter. The Company’s 
reclamation liabilities were determined  based on the present value of the expected expenditures required 
to settle the  reclamation obligation s. Reclamation obligation s are  capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying 
value and amortized over the life of the related asset . Estimates of r eclamation costs are periodically 
adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present value resulting from the passage of time and revisions 
to the estimates of either the timing or amount of reclamation costs . Of the total reclamation liabilities at 
June 30, 2 025, $30.1 million was included in current liabilities representing expenditures expected to  be 
incurred to settle reclamation obligati ons over the next 12 months. The remaining  $441.8  million of 
reclamation liabilities are longer term and are included in non -current liabilities.  
 
Employee -based benefits  
Employee -related benefits obligations included in current liabilities totaled $11.2 million and mainly 
related to accrued payroll and withholding taxes  owed in relation to the workforce obtained through the 
Porcupine Acquisition. An additional $3.6 million of employee -based benefits obligations were included 
in non -current liabilities at June 30, 2025. These obligations related to future employee pension benefit 
obligations.  
 
NON -CURRENT LIABILITIES  
 
Non -current liabilities at June 30, 2025,  totaled $ 889.4  million versus $1.6 million at December 31, 202 4. 
In addition to the long -term portions of reclamation liabilities and employee -benefits obligations, other 
new non -current liabilities added as at June 30, 2025  included liabilities related to the  Franco -Nevada 
Royalties , and a deferred consideration payable liability reflecting the $150 .0 million of Deferred 
Consideration included as part of the Porcupine Acquisition , and deferred income tax payable .

20  Deferred Revenue  
The deferred revenue  liabilit y totaled $ 299.0 million at June 30, 2025 , reflecting proceeds of $300.0 
million at the completion of the Acquisition under the Franco -Nevada Royalties, as well as $5.6 million of 
interest expense to reflect the significant financing component associated with the Franco -Nevada 
Royalties, partially offset by $6.6 million of initial payments made during Q2 2025. The deferred revenue 
liability will be amortized over the estimated LOM of the Porcupine Operations. It will also be adjusted by 
the Company’s cost of debt to reflect the financing component o f the arrangement.   
 
Deferred Consideration  
Deferred consideration payable liability totaled $9 7.2 million at June 30, 2025. The  fair value of the 
Deferred Consideration at the closing of the Porcupine Acquisition, based on estimated present value, 
was $92.9 million. The increase to $97.2 million at June 30, 2025,  resulted from  accretion as well as 
currency translation adjustments.

development  company , to a growing gold producer anchored in Northern Ontario, with three operating 
mines and significant growth potential through existing projects and exploration upside.  The change in 
the Company’s business portfolio significantly impacts the comparability of results in Q2 2025, and in 
future quarters, to quarterly results  prior to April 15, 2025 .

measures or ratios presented by other issuers and the non -GAAP measures and ratios do not have any 
standardized meaning. Accordingly, these measu res and ratios are included to provide additional 
information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance 
prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. These measures do not have any standardized 
meanin g prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

Free Cash Flow  
Free Cash Flow is a non -GAAP performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net 
of cash flows invested in mineral property, plant, and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets. 
The Company believes that this measure is useful t o the external users in assessing the Company’s ability 
to generate cash flow  after capital investments and build the cash resources of the Company.  
 
Free cash flow is reconciled to the amounts include in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as

Sustaining and Growth Capital  
Sustaining capital and growth capital are non-GAAP  measures. Sustaining capital is defined as capital  
required to maintain  current operations at existing levels. Growth capital is defined as capital  
expenditures for major growth projects or  enhancement capital for significant infrastructure  
improvements at existing operations. Both measurements are used by  management to assess the 
effectiveness of investment programs.

Operating Cash Costs and Operating Cash Costs per Ounce Sold   
Operating cash costs , operating cash costs  per tonne , per ounce sold  are non -GAAP  measures. In the gold 
mining  industry, these metrics are common performance measures but do not have any standardized 
meaning under  GAAP . Operating cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing , 
administration  and royalty  expenses  but exclude  depreciation and depletion and reclamation costs. 
Operating cash cost per  ounce sold is based on ounces sold and is  calculated by dividing operating cash 
costs by volume of gold ounces sold  is based on ounces produced  and is  calculated by dividing operating 
cash costs , excluding movements in precious metals and in -circuit inventory, by volume of gold ounces 
produced . 
 
The Company discloses operating cash costs and operating cash cost per tonne and per ounce as it  
believes the measures  provide valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company’s  
operational performance and ability to  generate cash flow. The most directly comparable measure  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

per ounce of gold should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for  measures prepared in 
accordance with GAAP . 
 
AISC and AISC per Ounce Sold   
AISC and AISC per ounce are non-GAAP  measures. These measures are intended to assist readers in 
evaluating the total costs of producing and selling gold from current operations. While there is no 
standardized meaning across the industry for this measure, the Company’s definition conforms to the 
definition of AISC as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance note dated June 27, 2013.  
The Company defines AISC as the sum of operating costs (as defined and calculated above), sustaining 
capital,  exploration expense,  corporate expenses, lease payments relating to sustaining assets, and 
reclamation cost accretion and depreciation related to current operations. Corporate expenses include 
general and administrative expenses, net of transaction related costs, severance ex penses for 
management changes and interest income. AISC excludes growth capital expenditures, growth 
exploration expenditures,  reclamation cost accretion and depreciation not related to current operations, 
lease payments related to non -sustaining assets, interest expense, debt repayment and taxes.

Average Realized Price per Ounce Sold  
In the gold mining industry, average realized price per ounce sold is a common performance measure that 
does not have any  standardized meaning. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance  
with GAAP  is revenue from gold sales.  Average realized price per ounces sold should not be considered in  
isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP . The measure is intended to  
assist readers in evaluating the total revenues realized in a period from  current operations.

Adjusted N et Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per Share  
Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are used by management and investors to 
measure the  underlying operating performance of the Company.  Adjusted net earnings is defined as net  
earnings adjusted to exclude the after -tax impact of specific items that are significant,  but not reflective  
of the underlying operations of the Company, including foreign exchange gains and losses  and other  non-
recurring items.  Adjusted net earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of  
shares outstanding for adjusted net  earnings per share.

27  Working Capital  
Working capital is a non-GAAP  measure. In the gold mining industry, working capital is a common measure  
of liquidity, but  does not have any standardized meaning.  The most directly comparable measure  
prepared in accordance with GAAP  is current assets and current liabilities. Working  capital is calculated 
by deducting current liabilities from current assets. Working capital should not be considered in isolation  
or as a substitute f or measures prepared in accordance with GAAP . The measure is intended to assist 
readers  in evaluating  the Co mpany’s liquidity. Working capital is reconciled to the amounts in the 
Consolidated  Statements of Financial Position as  follows:  
 
 As at June 30  As at December 31,  
  2025   2024 
Current assets  $ 393,007  $ 22,937

Working capital  $ 225,884  $ 16,953  
 
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
 
The operations of the Company are speculative due to the high -risk nature of its business, which is the 
acquisition, financing, exploration and development of mining properties. Additional risks not currently 
known to the Company, or that the Company curre ntly deems  to be  immaterial, may also impair the 
Company’s operations. If any of these risks occur, including the financial risks described above, the 
Company’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.   
 
Key risks are described below. For a detailed discussion of risks, refer to the Company’s annual MD&A and 
Annual Information Form (“AIF”) for the year ended December 31, 2024, available on the Company’s 
website.  
 
This MD&A also contains forward -looking information that involve s risks and uncertainties. The 
Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward -looking 
statements as a result of the risks faced by the Company as described in the documents incorporated by 
reference herein. Refer to  the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward -Looking Information”.  
 
Risks Relating to the Porcupine  Complex  Acquisition  
 
Potential Dispute with First Nations Community Could Have Adverse Consequences Following the 
Porcupine Acquisition Closing  
In November 2024, the Taykwa Tagmou Nation ("TTN") filed a Statement of Claim against His Majesty the 
King in Right of Ontario represented by the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources 
("Ministry of Mines") and the Ministry of Environme nt, Conservation and Parks (the "Ministry of the 
Environment"), G oldcorp Canada Ltd. (“GCL”) , and Newmont , claiming the Crown failed to protect TTN's 
lands and way of life from the impacts of mining in the Treaty No. 9 areawithout consulting TTN or 
consid ering the impacts to TTN's Treaty rights (the "TTN Litigation"). TTN had previously brought an 
application for Judicial Review in July 2023 requesting relief respecting three of the mining exploration 
permits issued to GCL. In January 2025, Newmont and GCL filed a Notice of Intent to Defend with respect 
to this Action. His Majesty the King in Right of Ontario also filed a Notice of Intent to Defend in November DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.  
MANAGEMENT’ S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED June 30, 2025, and 2024  
(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
28  2024. In June 2025, TTN amended it claim naming the Company and its wholly -owned subsidiary, Dome 
Mine Ltd., as defendants, following the completion of the Porcupine Acquisition. The Co mpany  believes 
this claim is without merit.  
 
The outcome of this claim is uncertain and could result in delays, additional costs, or modifications to 
previously issued permits, future permit applications  and difficulty in community relations.  
 
Unexpected Liabilities Related to the Porcupine Acquisition  
In connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, there may be liabilities including environmental liabilities 
associated with the Porcupine Complex that the Co mpany  failed to discover or was unable to quantify in 
the due diligence which it conducted in connection with the Porcupine Acquisition and the Co mpany  may 
not be indemnified for some or all of these liabilities. The Company  may discover that it has acquired 
substantial undisclosed liabilities. The discovery of any material liabilities, or the inability to obtain full 
indemnification for such liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Co mpany 's business, 
financial condition or future prospects. While the Co mpany  has estimated these potential liabilities for 
the purpose of completing the Porcupine Acquisition , there can be no assurance that any resulting liability 
including environmental liabilities will not exceed the Co mpany 's estimates.  
 
The existence of undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse impact on the Co mpany 's business, financial 
condition and results of operations.  
 
Nature of Acquisitions  
Acquisitions of mineral properties are based in large part on  engineering, environmental and economic 
assessments made by the acquiror, independent engineers and consultants. These assessments include a 
series of assumptions regarding such factors as operational performance, status of and impact of policy, 
legislati on and regulations and effective tax rates. Many of these factors are subject to change and are 
beyond Discovery's control. All such assessments involve a measure of engineering, environmental and 
regulatory uncertainty that could result in lower revenue o r higher operating or capital expenditures than 
anticipated.  
 
Information Provided by GCL  
Information related to the Porcupine Complex in this MD&A  is based on information provided by GCL. 
Although the Co mpany  has conducted what it believes to be a prudent and thorough level of investigation 
with respect to the Porcupine Complex in connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, a certain degree of 
risk remains regarding the accuracy and completeness of such information. While the Co mpany  has no 
reason to believe the information obtained from GCL is misleading, untrue or incomplete, the Co mpany  
cannot assure the accuracy or completeness of such information, nor can the Co mpany  compel GCL to 
disclose events which may have occurred or may affect the completeness or accuracy of such information, 
but which are unknown to the Co mpany . 
 
Failure to Realize Porcupine Acquisition Benefits  
There is a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition may fail to materialize 
or may not occur within the time periods that Discovery anticipates. The realization of such benefits may 
be affected by a number of factors, man y of which are beyond the control of the Co mpany . DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED June 30, 2025, and 2024  
(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
29   
Moreover, a variety of factors, including those risk factors set forth in this AIF, may adversely affect the 
Company 's ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Porcupine Acquisition.  
 
Integration of the Porcupine Complex  
Although the Co mpany  expects to realize certain benefits as a result of  the Porcupine Acquisition, there 
is a possibility that the Co mpany  is unable to fully realize on the efficiencies and benefits of the integration  
or may be unable to do so within the a nticipated timeframe.  
 
The Co mpany  expects to implement certain operational improvements and cost -savings initiatives 
following the completion of the Porcupine Acquisition. Any cost -savings that the Co mpany  realizes from 
such efforts may differ materially from the Co mpany 's estimates. In addition, any cost -savings that the 
Company  realizes may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in 
other expenses. The Co mpany 's operational improvements and cost -savings plans are subject to 
numerous risks and uncerta inties that may change at any time.  
 
To effectively integrate the Porcupine Complex, Discovery must establish appropriate operational, 
administrative, finance, and management systems and controls functions relating to the Porcupine 
Complex. These efforts, together with the ongoing integration  following the closing of the Porcupine 
Acquisition, will require substantial attention from Discovery's management. This diversion of 
management attention, as well as any other difficulties which Discovery may encounter in completing the 
Acquisition and i ntegration process, could have an adverse effect on Discovery's business, financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
 
Discovery Will Rely on GCL Following Completion of the Porcupine Acquisition for Certain Services  
In connection with the Porcupine Acquisition, Discovery and GCL pursuant to which GCL has agreed to 
provide, or cause its affiliates to provide, certain services to Discovery that are required for the operation 
of the Porcupine Complex in a similar manner as the Porcupine Complex was operated immediately prior 
to the Porcupine Acquisition Closing. As a result, Discovery will be reliant on GCL’s personnel, good faith, 
contractual compliance, expertise and judgment in providing the services under the T SA, whe re the 
Company 's ability to manage operational risks may be limited. Accordingly, Discovery may be exposed to 
adverse developments in the business and affairs of GCL, its management and to its financial strength.  
 
There can be no assurance that the services provided by GCL pursuant to the T SA will be adequate for the 
Company  to operate the Porcupine Complex and facilitate the efficient and effective transition of business 
operations as currently contemplated, or at all. If GCL does not perform the services under the T SA as 
currently contemplated, the operations and financial performance of the Porcupine Complex may be 
negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition  and 
future performance of the Co mpany . If, after the expiration of the T SA, the Co mpany  is unable to perform 
these services or replace them in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those under 
the T SA, the Co mpany  may experience operational problems and an increase in its costs.  
 
Failure by GCL to meet its obligations under the T SA could have a material adverse effect on the operation 
of the Porcupine Complex , which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the business, financial 
condition and future performance of the Co mpany . DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED June 30, 2025, and 2024  
(Expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
 
30  Litigation and Public Attitude towards the Porcupine Acquisition  
The Co mpany  may be exposed to increased litigation from shareholders or other third -parties in 
connection with the Porcupine Acquisition. Such litigation may have an adverse impact on the Co mpany 's 
business and results of operations or may cause disruptions to the Co mpany 's operations. Even if any such 
claims are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert the time 
and resources of management.  
 
Furthermore, public attitudes towards the Porcupine Complex  could result in negative press coverage and 
other adverse public statements affecting the Co mpany . Adverse press coverage and other adverse 
statements could negatively impact the ability of the Co mpany  to achieve the benefits of the Porcupine 
Acquisition or take advantage of various business and market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects 
of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material advers e 
effect on the Co mpany 's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
 
Porcupine Acquisition and Related Costs  
The Co mpany  incurred  significant costs associated with completing the Porcupine Acquisition and will 
continue to incur significant costs through integrating the operations of Discovery and the Porcupine 
Complex . The substantial majority of such costs are non-recurring expenses resulting from the Porcupine 
Acquisition and consist primarily of transaction costs related to the Porcupine Acquisition. Additional 
unanticipated costs may be incurred through the integration of the Porcupine Complex into Discovery's 
existing business and such costs, if incurred, may have a negative effect on the Co mpany 's business, 
operations and financial performance and cash flows.  
 
Increased Indebtedness  
In financing the Porcupine Acquisition, Discovery may incur additional debt under the Debt Facility  and/or 
any other debt facilities which are entered into by the Company . Such borrowing, to the extent incurred, 
would increase Discovery's consolidated indebtedness. Such additional indebtedness will increase 
Discovery's interest expense and debt service obligations and may have a negative effect on Discovery's 
results of op erations and/or credit ratings. Such increased indebtedness may also make Discovery's results 
more sensitive to increases in interest rates. Discovery's degree of leverage could have other important 
consequences for purchasers, including: (i) having a negative effect on Discovery's issuer debt rating; (ii) 
it may limit Discovery's ability t o obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt 
service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; (iii) it may limit Discovery's 
ability to declare dividends on the Common Shares; (iv) Discovery may b e vulnerable in a downturn in 
general economic conditions; and (v) Discovery may be unable to make capital expenditures that are 
important to its growth and strategies.  
 
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION  
 
Scientific and technical Information in this Circular with respect to the Company’s Cordero project has

31  Scientific and technical Information in this Circular with respect to the Company’s Porcupine complex has 
been prepared and presented based on the technical report entitled  “Porcupine Complex, Ontario, 
Canada, NI 43 -101 Technical Report on Preliminary Economic Assessment”  with an effective date of 
January 13, 2025, available on the Company’s SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca , and such scientific 
and technical information is subject to the assumptions and qualifications contained in the said technical 
report.  The Technical Report includes the results of a preliminary economic assessment which is 
preliminary in nature. It includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative 
geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be 
categorized as Mineral Reserves and there is no certainty that the estimates will be realized.  
 
The scientific and  technical information in this MD&A was reviewed and approved by Pierre Rocque, 
P.Eng., Chief Operating Officer of the Company and  Eric Kallio  P. Geo., Senior Vice President Exploration 
of the Company, who are recognized as a Qualified Person s (“QP s”) under the guidelines of National 
Instrument 43 -101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“ NI 43 -101”).  
 
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
 
The Canadian Securities Administrators have issued National Instrument 52 -109 - Certification of 
Disclosure in Issuers’ Annual and Interim Filings (“NI 52 -109”) which requires public companies in Canada 
to submit annual and interim certificates relating to  the design and effectiveness of the disclosure controls 
and procedures that are in use at the Company. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are 
designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported on a 
timely basis to senior management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, to enable this information to be reviewed and discussed so that appropriate decisions can be 
made regarding the timely public disclosure of th e information. Management has evaluated the 
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that they were 
effective as at June 30, 2025.   
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
NI 52 -109 also requires public companies in Canada to submit interim and annual certificates relating to 
the design of internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”) and an annual certificate that includes 
evaluating the operating effectiveness of ICFR. The Company’s ICFR is designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with IFRS  Accounting Standards . Management is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining ICFR. The Company used the 2013 Commission of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) framework as the basis for designing its ICFR. Due to its inherent 
limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect misstatem ents on a timely basis as such systems can only be 
designed to provide reasonable as opposed to absolute assurance. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
the effectiveness of ICFR to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inad equate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate. There have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls during the three 
and six months ended June 30, 2025,  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially 
affect, ICFR. The individuals performing the duties of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer have each evaluated the operating effectiveness of the Company’s IC FR as at June 30, 
2025,  and have concluded that the ICFR are effective.  DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

FORWARD -LOOKING INFORMATION  
 
Except for statements of historical fact, information contained, or incorporated by reference, herein 
constitutes “forward -looking information” and “forward -looking statements” within the meaning of 
applicable securities laws. Such information or statement s may relate to future events, facts or 
circumstances or the Company ’s future financial or operating performance or other future events or 
circumstances. Forward -looking information is often, but not always, identified by the use of words such 
as “seek”, “anticipate”, “plan”, “continue”, “planned”, “expect”, “project”, “pr edict”, “potential”, 
“targeting”, “intends”, “believe”, and similar expressions, or describes a “goal”, or variation of such words 
and phrases or states that certain actions, events or results “may”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “might” 
or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Statements relating to mineral resources are deemed to be 
forward -looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and 
assumptions, that the mineral resources described exist in the quantities pre dicted or estimated or that 
it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of such resources. Forward -looking statements in 
this MD&A  include, but may not be limited to, statements and expectations regarding: outlooks for the 
Porcupine Complex and t he Cordero Project pertaining to production rates, mining and processing rates, 
total cash costs, all -in sustaining costs, capital spending, cash flow, operational performance, mine life, 
value of operations and decreases to costs resulting from the intend ed mill expansion; intended 
infrastructure investments in, method of funding for, and timing of completion of the development and 
construction of the Cordero Project, planned continuation of negotiation of formal agreements with land 
owners and Mexican aut horities with respect to the Cordero Project, as well as other statements and 
information as to strategy, plans or future financial and operating performance, such as project timelines, DISCOVERY SILVER CORP.

of proceeds therefrom and the impact thereof on Discovery's financial condition;  and the Porcupine 
Complex, including the assumptions and qualifications contained in the Porcupine Technical Report (as 
defined herein). Forward -looking statements and forward -looking information are not guarantees of 
future performance and are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions of management at the 
date the statements are made, including among other things, the futur e prices of gold, silver, lead, zinc, 
and other metals, the price of other commodities such as coal, fuel and electricity, currency exchange 
rates and interest rates; favourable operating conditions, political stability, timely receipt of governmental 
appr ovals, licenses, and permits (and renewals thereof); access to necessary financing; stability of labour 
markets and in market conditions in general; availability of equipment; the estimation of mineral resource 
and mineral reserve estimates, and of any met allurgical testing completed to date; estimates of costs and 
expenditures to complete our programs and goals; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and 
development in general; there being no significant disruptions affecting the development and ope ration 
of the project, including possible pandemic; exchange rate assumptions being approximately consistent 
with the assumptions in the report; the availability of certain consumables and services and the prices for 
power and other key supplies being appr oximately consistent with assumptions in the report; labour and 
materials costs being approximately consistent with assumptions in the report and assumptions made in 
mineral resource estimates, including, but not limited to, geological interpretation, grad es, metal price 
assumptions, metallurgical and mining recovery rates, geotechnical and hydrogeological assumptions, 
capital and operating cost estimates, and general marketing, political, business and economic conditions. 
Many of these assumptions are inhe rently subject to significant business, social, economic, political, 
regulatory, competitive and other risks and uncertainties, contingencies, and other factors that are not 
within the control of Discovery Silver Corp. and could thus cause actual performan ce, achievements, 
actions, events, results or conditions to be materially different from those projected in the forward -
looking statements and forward -looking information.  
Forward -looking information and forward -looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the 
Company  to be materially different from any other future results, performance or achievements

35  CAUTIONARY NOTE TO UNITED STATES INVESTORS CONCERNING ESTIMATES OF 
MEASURED, INDICATED, AND INFERRED RESOURCES  
 
Information in this MD&A, including any information incorporated by reference, and disclosure 
documents of Discovery that are filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities concerning mineral 
properties have been prepared in accordance with the requ irements of securities laws in effect in Canada, 
which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws.  
Without limiting the foregoing, these documents use the terms “measured resources”, “indicated 
resources”, and “inferred resources”. Shareholders in the United States are advised that, while such terms 
are defined in and required by Canadian securities law s, the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the “ SEC”) does not recognize them. Under United States standards, mineralization may not 
be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be 
economical ly and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. United 
States investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated resources will 
ever be converted into reserves. Further, inferred resource s have a great amount of uncertainty as to 
their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. It is reasonably expected 
that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with 
continue d exploration; however, there is no certainty that these inferred mineral resources will be 
converted into mineral reserves, once economic considerations are applied. Under Canadian rules 
inferred mineral resources must not be included in the economic anal ysis, production schedules, or 
estimated mine life in publicly disclosed Pre -Feasibility or Feasibility Studies, or in the Life of Mine plans 
and cash flow models of developed mines. Inferred Mineral Resources can only be used in economic 
studies as provid ed under NI 43 -101. These standards are similar to, but differ in some ways from, the 
requirements of the SEC that are applicable to domestic United States reporting companies and foreign 
private issuers not eligible for the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Any mineral reserves and mineral 
resources reported by the Company  in accordance with NI 43 -101 may not qualify as such under SEC 
standards under Subpart 1300 of Regulation S -K. Therefore, United States investors are also cautioned 
not to assume th at all or any part of the inferred resources exist, or that they can be mined legally or 
economically. Disclosure of contained ounces is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; 
however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report resources as in place tonnage and grade without 
reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning descriptions of mineralization and 
resources contained in these documents may not be comparable to information made public by United 
States companies subject  to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC.
