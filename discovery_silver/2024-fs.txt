Independent auditor’s report 
To the Shareholders of Discovery Silver Corp. 
Our opinion 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of Discovery Silver Corp. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company) as at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IFRS Accounting Standards). 
What we have audited 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements comprise: 
 the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2024 and 2023; 
 the consolidated statements of loss and total comprehensive loss for the years then ended; 
 the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended; 
 the consolidated statements of changes in equity for the years then ended; and 
 the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the consolidated  financial  statements  section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. 
Independence 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. 
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. These matters were  
 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter 
Assessment of indicators of impairment of 
Cordero mineral property 
Refer to note  3 – Material accounting policies and 
note 5 – Critical judgments and estimates in 
applying accounting policies  to the  consolidated  
financial  statements. 
The carrying value of the Cordero mineral property, 
which is comprised of exploration and evaluation 
assets, was $84.9 million as at December 31, 2024. 
The carrying values of mineral properties are 
reviewed each reporting period or upon the 
occurrence of events or changes in circumstances 
indicating that the carrying values of assets may not 
be recoverable. If any such indicator exists, then an 
impairment test is performed by management. 
Indicators of impairment may include (i) the period 
during which the entity has the right to explore in 
the specific area has expired during the year or will 
expire in the near future; (ii) substantive 
expenditure on further exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral reserves and resources in the 
specific area is neither budgeted nor planned; (iii) 
sufficient data exists to support that extracting the 
reserves and resources will not be technically 
feasible or commercially viable based on technical 
studies or desktop studies; and (iv) facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount. No impairment 
indicators were identified by management for the 
Cordero mineral property as at December 31, 2024. 
We considered this a key audit matter due to the 
significance of the mineral property and the 
judgments made by management in its assessment 
of indicators of impairment, which led to subjectivity 
in performing procedures to test management's 
assessment. Our approach to addressing the matter included the 
following procedures, among others: 
 Assessed the judgment made by management 
in determining whether indicators of impairment 
for the Cordero mineral property existed, which 
include the following: 
‒ Obtained, for a sample of claims, by 
reference to government registries, 
evidence to support (i) the right to explore 
the area, and (ii) title expiration dates. 
‒ Read the Board of Directors' minutes and 
obtained budget approvals to evidence 
continued and planned substantive 
expenditure for exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral reserves and 
resources in the specific area. 
‒ Assessed whether there is any evidence 
that extracting the reserves and resources 
will not be technically feasible or 
commercially viable, or if other facts and 
circumstances suggest that the carrying 
amount exceeds the recoverable amount, 
by considering the press releases and 
technical report related to the release of the 
pre-feasibility study on the Cordero Silver 
Project and evidence obtained in other 
areas of the audit.  
 
Other information 
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management’s 
Discussion and Analysis. 
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the 
consolidated financial statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, and for such internal control as management 
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 
the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting 
process. 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  
 
As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control. 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by management. 
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If 
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern. 
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business units within the Company as a basis for forming an opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of 
the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion. 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.  
 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. 
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Marelize Barber.

The Company’s principal subsidia ry and its geographic location as of  December 31 , 2024 is as follows:  
 
Direct Parent Company  Location  Ownership 
Percentage  Properties  
Minera Titán S.A. de C.V.  Mexico  100%  Cordero  
 
All intercompany assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses , and cash flows arising from 
intercompany transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  
 
b) Currency of Presentation  
 
The Consolidated  Financial Statements  are presented in Canadian dollars which is the functional and 
presentation currency of the Company. The functional currency for the entities through which the 
Company conducts its operations is determined depending upon the primary economic environment 
in which they operate. The functional currency of the Mexican subsidiar ies is the Mexican peso 
(“MXP”).  
 
c) Foreign currency translation  
 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that 
date. Non -monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost  in foreign currencies are 
not re -translated. Total foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income statement 
and the unrealized portion is reported separately in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The 
foreign exchange differences ari sing from the translation of the subsidiary with functional currency 
different than the consolidated functional currency are recognized as currency translation 
adjustments in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of loss and total 
comprehe nsive loss.

 d) Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three  
months or less. The Company invests excess cash in high yield savings accounts maintained with  high 
credit -rated institutions.  
 
e) Mineral properties and equipment  
On initial acquisition, mineral properties and equipment are valued at cost, being the purchase price 
and the directly attributable costs of acquisition. The Company capitalizes cash and share -based 
payments made to acquire mineral properties . Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value 
and is not depreciated. Exploration and evaluation  costs are capitalized if a pre -feasibility study 
demonstrates that future economic benefits are probable. Upon disposal or abandonment, the 
carrying amount of minera l properties are derecognized and any associated gains or losses are 
recognized in profit and loss.   
 
i. Depreciation  
Depreciation is recognized in earnings or loss on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of each part of an item (component), since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of 
consumption of economic benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful lives for assets and 
components that are depreciated on a straight -line basis range from three to 10 years . 
 
Depreciated assets  Useful Life  
Computer equipment and software  3 years  
Vehicles  4 years  
Office equipment and furniture  5 to 10 years  
Buildings and machinery  5 to 10 years  
 
ii. Impairment  
The carrying values of mineral properties are reviewed each reporting period or upon the occurrence 
of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying values of assets may not be 
recoverable.  If any such indicator exists, then an impairmen t test is performed by management. 
Indicators of impairment may include (i) the period during which the entity has the right to explore 
in the specific area has expired during the year or will expire in the near future; (ii) substantive 
expenditure on furt her exploration for and evaluation of mineral reserves and resources in the 
specific area is neither budgeted nor planned; (iii) sufficient data exists to support that extracting the 
reserves and resources will not be technically feasible or commercially viable based on technical 
studies or desktop studies; and (iv) facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount.  
 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but to an amount that does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairm ent loss been recognized for 
the asset or CGU in prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in 
earnings or loss.  Discovery Silver Corp.

 Where an item of mineral properties and equipment is disposed of, it is derecognized and the 
difference between its ’ carrying value and net sales proceeds is disclosed as earnings or loss on 
disposal in the consolidated financial statements of operations and total comprehensive loss. Any 
items of mineral properties and equipment that cease to have future economic benefi ts are 
derecognized with any gain or loss included in the financial year in which the item is derecognized.  
 
f) Exploration and evaluation assets  
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are comprised of costs that are directly attributable to: 
researching and analy zing existing exploration data , conducting geological studies, exploratory 
drilling and sampling , examining and testing extraction and treatment m ethods, and compiling 
economic studies. Exploration  expenditures are costs incurred in the search for resources suitable 
for commercial exploitation. Evaluation expenditures are costs incurred in determining the technical 
feasibility and commercial viability of a mineral resource. Exploration and evaluatio n expenditures 
are capitalized when there is a high degree of confidence in the project’s viability and thus it is 
probable that future economic be nefits will flow to the Company . When a project is considered to 
no longer have commercially viable prospects for the Company, exploration and evaluation costs in 
respect of that property are assessed as impaired and written off to the statement of loss and total 
comprehensive loss. The C ompany also assesses mineral property costs for impairment when other 
facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed its recoverable 
amount.  
g) Leases  
At inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease based 
on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognize s a right -of-use asset and a lease liability 
at the lease commencement date.  
 
Right -of-use assets  
The right -of-use asset is initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the 
underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. Right -of-use 
assets are classified as other fixed assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.  
 
The assets are depreciated to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right -of-use asset or the 
lease term using the straight -line method as this most closely reflects the expected pattern of 
consumption of the future economic benefits. The lease term includes periods covered by an option 
to extend if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.  
 
Lease liabilities  
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid 
at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate 
cannot be readily determined, the Company’s increment al borrowing rate. Generally, the Company 
uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is measured at amortized Discovery Silver Corp.  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
For the Years  Ended December 31 , 202 4 and 202 3

 cost using the effective interest method. Interest recognized on the consolidated statement of 
operations and comprehensive loss is classified as a financing cost.  
 
The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a 
change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected 
to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Com pany changes its assessment of whether 
it will exercise a purchase, extension , or termination option. A corresponding adjustment is made to 
the carrying amount of the right -of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of 
the right -of-use asset has been reduced to zero upon remeasurement of the liability.  
 
h) Provisions  
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present liability for 
statutory, contractual, constructive, or legal obligations that can be estimated reliably, and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions 
are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre -tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the  time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding 
of the discount is recognized as finance cost.  
 
i) Financial instruments  
Measurement  
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. On initial recognition, all financial assets and liabilities are recorded at 
fair value, net of attributable transaction costs , except for financial assets and liabilities classified as 
fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). Transaction costs of financial assets and liabilities classified 
as at FVTPL are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  
 
Subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities depends on the classifications of such 
assets and liabilities. Management determines the classification on initial recognition.  
 
Subsequent to the initial measurement at fair value, all recognized financial assets are required to 
be subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value. Financial assets that are held within a 
business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, an d that have contractual 
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding are 
generally measured at amortized cost in subsequent periods. Financial assets that have a business 
model whose objective is achieved by bo th collecting the contractual cash flows and selling financial 
assets are generally measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”). All 
other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”) in subsequent 
accounting periods. In addition, on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for 
trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s 
FVTOCI, with only dividend income generally recognized in prof it or loss. Transaction costs for 
financial assets held at FVTPL are expensed, for all other financial assets, they are recognized at fair 
value at initial measurement plus any directly attributable transaction costs.  
 
Financial liabilities are designated as either: (i) FVTPL; or (ii) other financial liabilities. All financial 
liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost except for financial liabilities Discovery Silver Corp.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
For the Years  Ended December 31 , 202 4 and 202 3 
 
 11 
 at FVTPL. The classification determines the method by which the financial liabilities are carried on 
the balance sheet , subsequent to inception , and how changes in value are recorded.  
 
For an impairment of financial assets , an ‘expected credit loss’ model is applied which requires a loss 
allowance to be recognized based on expected credit losses. This applies to financial assets measured 
at amortized cost. The expected credit loss model is updated at each reporting date to r eflect 
changes in initial recognition.  
 
j) Share Capital  
Common shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of 
common shares are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
 
k) Warrants  
Warrants are classified as equity, separately from common shares and are valued at their fair value 
on grant date. The fair value of the warrants issued  is measured using the Black -Scholes pricing 
model, considering the terms and conditions upon which the warrants were granted. The impact of 
changes to the original terms of a warrant grant or revisions to original estimates are accounted for 
prospectively  and recognized in equity with a corresponding change in contributed surplus on the 
date of remeasuremen t. Consideration received on the exercise of warrants is recorded as share 
capital and the related contributed surplus is transferred from  warrants, within the Company’s 
equity accounts.  
 
l) Share -based compensation  
The Company recognizes share -based compensation expense for share purchase options, restricted 
share units  (“RSU”) and deferred share units (“DSU”) granted to directors, officers, and employees 
under the Company’s equity -based incentive plans.  
 
Share purchase options  
 
The fair value of options granted is recognized as a share -based payment expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and each tranche is 
recognized on a graded -vesting basis over the period during which the options vest. The fair value of 
the options granted is measured using the Black -Scholes opt ion pricing model, considering the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The Company annually revises its estimates of 
the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non -market vesting conditions. It 
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a 
corresponding adjustment to reserve.  
 
In situations where equity instruments are issued to non -employees and some or all the goods or 
services received by the entity as consideration cannot be specifically identified, they are measured 
at fair value of the share -based payment. Consideration received on the exercise of stock options is 
recorded as share capital and the related contributed surplus is transferred to share capital.

 Restricted share units  
 
The fair value of RSUs is determined by the market value of the underlying shares at the date of the 
grant. Under the Company’s RSU Plan, the Board of Directors has the discretion to settle the vested 
RSUs in cash or equity. As the Company does not have a present obligation to settle the issued RSUs 
in cash, the RSUs issued have been treated as equity -settled instruments. The fair values of RSUs at 
the date of gra nt are expensed over the vesting periods with a corresponding increase to equity. At 
the end of  each reporting period, the Company re -assesses its estimates of the number of awards 
that are expected to vest and recognizes the impact of any revisions to this estimate in equity.  
 
Deferred share units  
 
DSUs awarded to non -executive directors may be settled in cash or equity at the discretion of the 
Board of Directors and are measured at the fair value which is determined based on the closing share 
price of the Company on the date of the grant. As the Company does not have a present obligation 
to settle the issued DSUs in cash, the DSUs issued have been treated as equity -settled instruments.  
The fair values of the DSUs at the date of grant are expensed over the vesting periods with a 
corresponding increase to equity.  
 
m) Income taxes  
Income tax on the earnings or loss for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognized in earnings or loss in the statements of operation except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which  case it is recognized in equity.  
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using 
tax rates enacted or substa ntively  enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable 
in respect of previous years.  
 
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary di fferences: the initial recognition of 
assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable operations, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly 
controlled entit ies to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising on the 
initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax ra tes that are expected to be 
applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the reporting date.  
 
A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary 
differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed  at each reporting date and are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

 n) Total comprehensive loss  
Total comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income (loss). The 
Company has other comprehensive income (loss) components  result ing from  currency translation 
adjustments from the functional currency of MXP in Discovery Mexico to the presentation currency 
of CAD in the consolidated financial statements.  
 
o) Earnings (loss) per share  
Basic earnings or loss per share (“EPS”) represents the profit or loss for the period, divided by the 
weighted average number of common shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS represents the 
profit for the period, divided by the weighted average number of common shares in issue during the 
period plus the weighted average number of dilutive shares that could result from the exercise of 
stock options , warrants and other similar instruments where the inclusion of these items would not 
be anti -dilutive. When a loss per share calculation based on the fully diluted number of shares would 
be less than the loss per share calculated on the basic number of sh ares, diluted losses per share is 
anti-dilutive and accordingly, the diluted loss per share would be the same as the basic loss per share.  
 
4. ACCOUNTING P RONOUNCEMENTS   
Adoption of New Accounting Standards  
 
The new standards, or amendments to standards and interpretations that were adopted  by the 
Company,  effective January 1, 202 4, are as follows:  
 
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non -Current (Amendment to IAS 1)  
 
The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies 
determine whether,  in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain 
settlement date should be classified as  current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or 
non-current.  
 
The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated  
financial statements.  
 
Future Accounting Standards and Interpretations  
 
The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange  Rates  (Amendment to IAS 21) 
 
The amendments address the l ack of exchangeability which applies when one currency cannot be 
exchanged into another  as a result, for example, of  government -imposed controls on capital imports 
and exports, or a limitation on the volume of foreign currency transactions that can be undertaken at 
an official exchange rate. The amendments clarify when a currency is considered exchangeable into 
another currency, and how an entity estimates a spot rate for currencies that lack exchangeability. The 
amendments intro duce new disclosures to help financial statement users assess the impact of using an 
estimated exchange rate.

 14 
 This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025. The adoption of 
these amendments is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements . 
 
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments  (Amendment to I FRS 9 and IFRS 7 ) 
 
The amendments clarify  that financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized and derecognized at 
settlement date except for regular way purchases or sales of financial assets and financial liabilities 
meeting conditions for a new exception. The new exception permits companies to elect to derecognize 
certain financial liabilities settled via electronic payment systems earlier than the settlement date.  
 
They also provide guidelines to assess contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets, which 
apply to all contingent cash flows, including those arising from environmental, social, and governance 
ESG linked features. Additionally, these amendments introduce new disclosure requirements and 
update others.  
 
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 6. The impact of 
these amendments on the Company’s financial statements has not yet been evaluated . 
 
Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (“IFRS 18”)  
 
IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1  – Presentation of Financial Statements , which sets out presentation and base 
disclosure requirements for financial statements. The changes, which mostly affect the income 
statement, include the requirement to classify income and expenses into three new categories – 
operating, investing and fin ancing – and present subtotals for operating profit or loss and profit or loss 
before financing and income taxes.  
 
Further, operating expenses are presented directly on the face of the income statement – classified 
either by nature (e.g. employee compensation), by function (e.g. cost of sales) or using a mixed 
presentation. Expenses presented by function require more d etailed disclosures about their nature.  
 
IFRS 18 also provides enhanced guidance for aggregation and disaggregation of information in the 
financial statements, introduces new disclosure requirements for management -defined performance 
measures ( “MPMs ”) and eliminates classification options for interest and dividends in the statement of 
cash flows.  Non-GAAP measures that meet the definition of MPMs will be subject to the disclosure 
requirements  
 
This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 202 7. The impact of 
these amendments on the Company’s financial statements has not yet been evaluated . 
 
5. CRITICAL JUDGMENTS AND  ESTIMATES IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS  Accounting Standards  
requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimate s and underlying assumptions are reviewed on Discovery Silver Corp.  
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the Years  Ended December 31 , 202 4 and 202 3 
 
 15 
 an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates 
are revised and applied prospectively.  
 
a) Critical accounting judgments  
 
The significant areas of judgment considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements include, but are not limited to:  
 
i. Functional currency  
 
The functional currency for each of the Company and its subsidiaries is the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Company has determined that 
for each of the Canadian entities, the functional currency is CAD and for  the Mexican subsidiar ies 
the functional currency is MXP. Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation from 
functional to presentation currency are recognized each period in other comprehensive income 
(loss) and may or may not be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss depending on future 
events.  
 
ii. Economic recoverability and probability of future economic benefits of exploration, evaluation 
and development costs  
The Company makes determinations whether development and related costs incurred which 
have been capitalized are economically recoverable. Management uses several criteria in its 
assessments of economic recoverability and probability of future economic bene fits including 
geological and metallurgical information, economic assessments and existing permits for land 
access and drilling. The estimates contained within these criteria could change over ti me which 
could affect the economic recoverability of capitali zed costs.  
 
b) Critical accounting estimates  
The information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in 
preparing the financial statements is as follows:  
 
i. Impairment charges  
The Company assesses its CGUs at each reporting date to determine whether any indication of 
impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable 
amount is made, which is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
 
Management periodically reviews the carrying values of its exploration and evaluation assets 
with internal and external mining professionals. A decision to abandon, reduce or expand a 
specific project is based upon many factors including general and specific assessments of 
resources, forecast future metal prices, forecast future costs of exploring, and the general 
likelihood that the Company wil l continue exploration. The Company does not set a 
predetermined holding period for properties with unproven reser ves. However, properties 
which have not demonstrated suitable mineral concentrations at the conclusion of each phase Discovery Silver Corp.

(Expressed in Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)  
For the Years  Ended December 31 , 202 4 and 202 3 
 
 16 
 of an exploration program are re -evaluated to determine if future exploration is warranted and 
their carrying values are recoverable.  
 
ii. Sales tax recoverability  
The Company incurs significant expenditures for the purchase of goods and services on which 
sales tax is paid (“GST/HST” in Canada and “IVA” in Mexico). The net amount paid is recoverable 
but is subject to review and assessment by the relevant tax authorities (Canada Revenue Agency 
(“CRA”) in Canada and the Servicio de Administración Tributaria (“SAT”) in Mexico). The 
Company files GST/HST returns on a qua rterly basis with the CRA and regularly files the required 
IVA returns and all supporting documentation  with SAT.  
 
Management applies significant judgment in assessing the recoverability of the IVA including: i) 
collections of previous claims made with the tax authority received during and in prior years; ii) 
communications with tax authorities and iii) review of the appropriateness of the supporting 
information.  
 
The Company is in regular contact with SAT in respect of its IVA filings and believes the full 
amount of its IVA receivables will ultimately be received; however, the timing of recovery of 
these amounts and the nature and extent of any adjustments to the Company’s IVA receivables 
remains uncertain. Management assesses collectability and classification of the asset between 
current and non -current at each reporting period.  If there is uncertainty surrounding 
collectability of a specific amount, the Company re cords a provision. Once there is an expectation 
of recovery, that specific amount is recognized as a long -term receivable and the related 
provision reversed (note 7).  
 
iii. Share -based payments  
The fair value of the estimated number of stock options , RSUs and DSUs, that will eventually vest 
is recognized as share -based compensation expense over the vesting period of the stock options 
with the corresponding increase in equity.  
 
Determining the fair value of stock options , RSUs and DSUs  require s the exercise of judgment 
related to the choice of a pricing model, the estimation of stock price volatility, the expected 
forfeiture rate , and the expected term of the underlying instruments. Option pricing models 
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected price volatility and 
expected life. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value 
estimate, and therefore the existing mo dels do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure 
of the fair value of the Company’s options at the date of grant. Any changes in the estimates or 
inputs utilized to determine fair value could result in a significant impact on the Company’s 
future operating results or on other components of equity.

The Company pays sales in Canada (“HST”) and its  Mexican subsidiaries pay value -added tax, Impuesto al 
Valor Agregado (“IVA”) on the purchase of goods and services. Both  HST and IVA paid is recoverable but 
subject to review and assessment by the respective tax authorities - Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) and 
the Mexican tax authority (“ SAT”). The complex application process and detailed review by SAT in Mexico 
can impact the collectability and timing of refunds.  
 
During the year  ended December 31, 2023 , SAT completed an audit and the Company received a net 
refund of $8.0 million, including interest and inflationary adjustments less legal fees. This refund was for 
a cumulative five -year return filed with SAT in 2022, for months beginning August  2017 through  May 2022  
(the “ Cumulative Refund”) . 
 
a) Current and non -current value -added tax receivables  
 
The Company has classified 100% of the HST receivable  balance of $298,497  as a current asset as 
amounts are refunded by the CRA within twelve months  following the return being filed . The 
Company exercises  judgement i n classifying the current and non -current portions of the IVA 
receivable  balance  however,  the timing of refunds can vary based on SAT ’s review process . IVA which 
is estimated to be collected within the next twelve months  is recorded  as a current  receivable  while 
IVA expected to be collective beyond twelve months is  classified as a non-current  receivable . The 
Company has recorded $ 2,819,754  as the current portion of the IVA receivable, and $ 2,153,568  as a 
non-current receivable.  
 
Since the receipt of the Cumulative Refund, SAT has since forcibly closed all outstanding receivable 
balances prior to 2017 . As a  result , during the year end ed December 31, 2023  the company 
recognized a net write off of $ 1,293,744 in IVA receivable relating to transactions prior to August 
2017 .   Discovery Silver Corp.

18. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  
The Company defines capital as its shareholder’s equity (comprised of issued share capital, contributed 
surplus and deficit). The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to support the Company’s 
main activities of identifying, defining , and developing mineral deposits, with the goal of creating 
shareholder value, as well ensuring that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations as 
they become due.  
 
The Company manages its capital structure to maximize its financial flexibility to enable the Company 
to respond to changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets and 
business opportunities. Management reviews its capi tal management approach on an ongoing basis 
and believes that this approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable. The current 
excess funds realized from the non -brokered private placements are invested in highly liquid, interest -
bearing m arketable securities with no restrictions on redemption.  
 
At December 31 , 202 4, the Company does not have any long -term debt outstanding and is not subject 
to any externally imposed capital requirements or debt covenants. There was no change to the 
Company’s approach to capital management during the year  ended  December 31 , 202 4. 
19. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash  and cash equivalents , other  receivable  and deposits, 
investments in marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and lease liabilities . 
 
Cash and cash equivalents , accounts receivable and deposits  are classified as receivables and are 
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.  Investments  in marketable securities  Discovery Silver Corp.

 are classified as receivables and are measured at fair value through profit and loss . Accounts payable and 
accrued liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are measured at amortized cost. These 
financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short -term nature.  
 
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and 
information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve 
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. 
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 
Financial instruments are classified into one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy according to the 
degree to which the inputs used in the fair value measurement are observable.  
 
• Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  
• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly 
or indirectly; and  
• Level 3: Inputs that are not based on observable market data.  
 
At December 31 , 2024 the Company had no financial instruments classified as Level 2 or 3.   
 
20. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
The Company is exposed to financial risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate 
risk and price risk. The aim of the Company’s overall risk management strategy is to reduce the potential 
adverse effect that these risks may hav e on the Company’s financial position and results. The Company’s 
Board of Directors has overall responsibility and oversight of management’s risk management practices. 
Risk management is carried out by the Board through the Nominating and Corporate Governa nce 
Committee with the policies being recommended for approval by the Board of Directors at least annually 
or when changes are required.  
 
a) Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with 
financial liabilities. The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have 
sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due. At December 31 , 202 4, the Company had a cash and 
cash equivalents balance of $29,310,579 (December 31, 20 23 – $58,944,459 ) to settle current 
liabilities of $8,607,312 (December 31, 20 23 – $12,168,225 ). The Company’s financial liabilities have 
contractual  maturities of less than 30 days and are subject to normal trade terms.   
 
At December 31 , 2024, the Company has no sources of revenue to fund its operating and 
development expenditures  and has historically relied solely on non-brokered private placements to 
fund its operations.  The Company’s cash balance at December  31, 202 4 is sufficient to  fund  the 202 5 
work  program  related to current operations as well as the existing administrative needs. The 
Company may require additional financing to accomplish long -term strategic objectives. Future 
funding may be obtained by means of an equity  or debt financing  (refer to note 23 “Events after the 
reporting period” for an update on equity and debt financing) . Discovery Silver Corp.

 b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to fulfill an obligation and cause 
the other party to incur a financial loss. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short -term 
investments, accounts receivable and prepaids and deposits are exposed to credit risk. The Company 
has assessed the credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and short -term investments as low as 
its funds are held in several highly rated Canadian financial institutions.  
 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk related to certain financial instruments as identified 
below, approximates the carrying value of these assets on the Company’s consolidated statements 
of financial position.

c) Market Risks  
 
Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors such as interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.   
 
i. Interest rate risk  
 
The Company has significant cash balances and no interest -bearing debt. The Company’s 
current policy is to invest excess cash in high -yield savings accounts  or other highly liquid 
interest -bearing short -term investments.  The Company regularly monitors its cash 
management policy.  
 
ii. Foreign currency risk  
 
The Company’s functional currency is the Canadian dollar. At  December 31 , 202 4, cash 
balances were held primarily in Canadian and US dollars.  Foreign currency risk is the risk that 
the value of the Company’s financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies will 
fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in the exchange rate between 
foreign currencies and the Canadian dollar could have a significant impact on the Company’s 
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  
 
The Company does not currently use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign 
currency risk , however exchange rates are continually monitored for any significant changes . 
A portion of the  Company’s exploration expenses are paid in USD , and over the past two 
years the Company  converted  a portion of its CAD  cash balances into USD  to reduce its 
currency risk exposure related to the CAD .

the Canadian Dollar would affect net loss at December 31 , 202 4 by approximately $469,716  
(December  31, 20 23: $779,844 ). 
 
iii. Price risk

securities. Equity security price risk is defined as the potential adverse impact on the 
Company’s net income or loss due to movements in individual prices of equity securities or 
price movem ents in the stock market generally. Commodity price risk is defined as the 
potential adverse impact on net income or loss and economic value due to commodity price 
movement and volatilit y. The Company closely monitors commodity prices, particularly as 
they  relate to base  and precious  metals, and movement s in the price of individual equity 
securities , and  movements in the stock market generally, to assist in determin ing the 
appropriate course of action to be taken by the Company.

 To fund the Transaction and provide liquidity in support of operating and growing the Porcupine 
Complex, Discovery has entered into binding commitments for approximately USD $555 million of 
financing, including $400 million related to royalty and debt agreements with Franco Nevada 
Corporation  (“Franco Nevada”) and approximately USD $155 million from a bought deal public offering 
of subscription receipts  (the “Bought Deal ”). The Bought Deal closed on February 3, 2025  and pursuant 
to the requirement of the Toro nto Stock Exchange  a special meeting will be held on March 27, 2025 to 
obtain shareholder approval  (the “Special Meeting”) . 
 
Pursuant to the Bought Deal, the Company issued an aggregate of 275,000,000 Subscription Receipts at 
an issue price of C$0.90 per Subscription Receipt, for gross proceeds of C$247,500,000, which includes 
25,000,000 Subscription Receipts issued pursuant to the exercise, in full, of t he over -allotment option 
granted to the underwriters in connection with the Bought Deal. If the issuance of  119.7 million common 
shares to Newmont  is not approved  by shareholders at the Special Meeting , Discovery will reduce this  
number  and issue approximately 94.5 million common shares  to Newmont, and the first deferred cash 
payment will be increased to approximately USD$53.3 million.  As part of the financing package with 
Franco -Nevada, the Company issued 3,900,000 share purchase warrants, exercisable at $0.95 with a 3 -
year expiry.  
 
Prior to the closing of the Transaction, Porcupine will be transferred into a newly formed corporation, 
Dome Mine Ltd. pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. On closing of the Transaction, all of the 
issued and outstanding common shares of Dome Mine Ltd.  will be sold to Discovery pursuant to a share 
purchase agreement. The Transaction is also subject to other customary conditions prior to the 
expected close in the first half of 2025.
